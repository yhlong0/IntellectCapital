1. Regarding regualtion, since Alibaba grow a lot, millions users active one the platform, there is huge responsibility come. Don't think goverment stop you doing a lot of thing, it is two-way conversation and why they need to control.
2. How BABA will be disrupt? The way human interact with machine, from desktop to mobile, we think hard what would be the next form of interaction and be prepared for that.
3. Why Alibaba bought hema and why Amazon bought whole food? When e-commerce company has local/offline store, it act like a fullfilment center. This will make delivery fast possible and give customers same experience from home or offline purchase. 
4. At what point to worry about project profitability? There is a gestation period(孕育期) which over 10 years. Within first 3-5 years, we focus to build a product consumer like, then in next 2-3 years we figure out a revenue model. At Alibaba, you never think about revenue model in the first three years, that's too early. From year 5 to year 7 you think about path to profitability. Beyond year 7, you try to harvest. But after year 10, you have to go back and reinvent yourself. That's the cycle of every our business unit.  
5. 年轻人才是未来，淘宝刚开始的时候没有人用，试图让40岁的大妈相信淘宝太难了。但是那些18岁的年轻人却是很好的目标群体，10年后这些18岁的28了，他们已然离不开淘宝了。投资年轻人，就是投资未来
