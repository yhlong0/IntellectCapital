# JD

### Why invest in JD?

- Liu Qiangdong is very honesty person
- Focus on best user experience, heavily invest in its own logiestic, people accuse JD spend so much money building the warehouse, it is burn the money. However, it is asset, the money not really "burned"(similiar to NIO power swap station).
- User experience as core buisness foundation, this is really the key to expand to global. 
- 文化和执行能力是京东的核心竞争力。
- Miss Cloud is one of the biggest mistake. 整体策略是比较保守的，因为重投入了物流，所以不敢再重投资其他方面，错失了很多非常好的机会，比如云。
- 未来以供应链为基础的技术与服务企业
