## CAN

### Why sell CAN

- CAN is a company heavily rely on BTC, however, BTC has nasty side, it could use for many illegal things. If 50% people use BTC for speculating/trading, 30% use for drug and other illegal stuff, only 20% is real good useage, I would like to stay away from it. 
- The management team use huge profit for share incentive plans, not company R&D, no dividen for shareholders, and they issue more shares. 
- AI chip has long way to go and not its major income

### How Canaan make money?

To understand how Canaan make money, we need to understand how mining works and what are the challenges. 

There are several factors could affect mining profits: 
1.	Bitcoin price
2.	Bitcoin halving (https://academy.binance.com/zh/halving)比特币产出减半

3.	Bitcoin network total hash rate 全网算力(https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)

4.	Mining machine hash rate, how fast it can compute. ( https://www.asicminervalue.com/)
5.	Mining machine power consumption, how much electricity it needs
6.	Payback period  https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/147506944

```
Machine Power Efficiency = electricity/hash rate
```

Here are the relationships: 
-	If machine you have consume less power and compute fast, you can make more profits than those “old machines”. 
-	However, when new powerful machines join the network, the whole network total hash rate increase, which made the competition between miners much higher and mining become difficult -> less profit.
-	When bitcoin price goes up, more people want to mine the coin and total network hash increase, depends on the bitcoin price / total network hash, if total hash increase much more than bitcoin price, miner won’t be profit.
-	When Bitcoin halving happen, less bitcoin will be produced in future, and miner profit less.  

How these factors affect Canaan profit? 

You can simply think when more people want to mine the bitcoin, that’s when Canaan has more profit, and the profit usually delay for couple months or even longer. The reason is when people see bitcoin price goes up, they start purchasing mining machine, willing to pay higher price. If Canaan machines out of stock, it will take couple months for chip to ready from TSMC, Samsung, STATS and etc. Then final assembly machine and delivery to customers. 

Challenge: What if bitcoin price goes down a lot?
People will stop mining, because you pay more for electricity than the coins value you get. People will pay less for the machine, you can calculate “fair” market machine price based on total network hash, bitcoin price and electricity price. 

If a machine cost $15,000, one-year electricity cost $5,000 and you can get 1 bitcoin/year, assume one bitcoin worth $20,000, You will break even after a year. If bitcoin price reduced to $15,000, minus the electricity cost $5,000. You might only be willing to pay $10,000 for the machine. As time goes, more powerful, cheaper machines will join the network, your profitability will get less and less. 

This is what happened to the Canaan since COVID, bitcoin price drop, they have to reduce the price to sell the machines, the supply chain is hard, cost for machines goes up and company struggling to make profit or even survive.  

One big change they made since Q2, Q3 2020 is planning to mine themselves (cooperate with other people, Canaan provide machines, share the profits). This actually break this down circle. When bitcoin price drop, instead of cheap selling the machine, they can use inventory machines to mine bitcoins. The more bitcoin price drop and the more machine they will deploy for mining, vice versa. In this way, when bitcoin price goes up, they could have a very good return from selling bitcoin and not selling their machines too cheap.
