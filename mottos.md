1. 我管理基金的资产从最初的几百万到现在已近100亿美元，收益增长50多倍，这其中真正驱动投资回报复合增长的正是知识和思考力的复合增长。只有思考力的增长速度超过资金增长速度，投资资金才会安全有效。
2. 在进行投资时，我向来认为，当你看到某样你真正喜欢的东西，你必须依照纪律去行动。为了解释这种哲学，巴菲特或芒格喜欢用棒球来打比方，我觉得特别受启发，虽然我本人根本不算棒球专家。泰德•威廉姆斯是过去七十年来唯一单个赛季打出.400打击率的棒球运动员。在《击球的科学》中，他阐述了他的技巧。他把击打区划分为七十七个棒球那么大的格子。只有当球落在他的‘最佳’格子时，他才会挥棒，即使他有可能因此而三振出局，因为挥棒去打那些‘最差’格子会大大降低他的成功率。作为一个证券投资者，你可以一直观察各种企业的证券价格，把它们当成一些格子。在大多数时候，你什么也不用做，只要看着就好了。每隔一段时间，你将会发现一个速度很慢、线路又直，而且正好落在你最爱的格子中间的‘好球’。那么你就全力出击。如此，不管你的天分如何，你都能极大地提高你的上垒率。许多投资者的共同问题是他们挥棒太过频繁。无论是个人投资者，还是受“机构行为铁律”所驱使的专业投资者，他们都有这种倾向；这种“机构行为铁律”的某一变种也是让我不再经营长/短对冲基金的原因。然而，另外一个与挥棒太过频繁相对立的问题也同样有害于长期的结果：你发现一个‘好球’，却无法用全部的资本去出击。

1. 把资源，时间分配到最适合，最能创造价值的地方。
2. 弱水三千，但取一瓢。在纷繁复杂，多变化的过程中，抓到你自己的这一瓢。随着能力增加，视野扩大，这个瓢可以越做越大。但是刚开只有小小的一瓢。（能力圈，投资自己懂的东西）

## 查理 芒格

1. Know the edge of your own competency(the ability to do something successfully or efficiently). It is not a competency if you don't know the edge of it. I's rather deal with a guy with an IQ of 130 who think it's 125 than the guy with the IQ of 180 who thinks its 200.
2. What are the traits of good investors?
   - You have to know a lot
   - Partly it is temperament(天性), partly it is deferred gratification(延迟满足). You got to be willing to wait.
   - It's a weird combination of patience and aggression. 
3. In the early days when Charlie and Warren talked about their way of doing things(Value investing), which is working so well, they found some people got it, and they instantly converted to their way and did very well. And some people, no matter how carefully they explained it, and no matter how successful they were, they could never adapt to it. They either got it fast or they didn't get it at all.  

## 巴菲特

1. How to grow small sums of Money? Find small securities in your area of competance, occasionally find "wrinkles in the market". When working with a small sum there is an opportunity for a high rate of return. Warren, hedgefunds and analysts do not pay attention to smaller securities, less people aware, less competition, less media coverage and seen as speculative.
2. Diversification is generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing. Diversification is a protection against ignorance. There aren't that many wonderful businesses, diversification allow you to achieve average. It's confession that you don't really understand the business that you own. Three wonderful businesses is more than you need in this life.
3. Read stock chart won't help you understand the business. When looking at annual report, I like to know as much as I can about the person that's running the business and how they think about the business and what's really going on with the business. I like to understand generally what's going on in all kinds of business that in the same industrial. If I invest A and there are 8 companies in same industrial, I want reports from all of them, so that I can understand how company A is doing. Reading wall street report won't give you any idea, company annual report can enlight you more. 
4. A great company is gonna be great for thirty years, not three years. If you take a trip for 20 years, you should be totally ok for leaving the money with no orders.You know when you back, it's gonna be a terribly strong company 
5.  Cinderella of the ball(Stock bubble): You there, having a wonderful time, the dance partners are getting prettier and you think just one more dance, one more good-looking guy, one more glass of champagne. You think you can get out there at midnight and of course everybody else thinks they're going to get out of there midnight too. 
In the end it does turn to pumpkins and mice. The problem with this stock dance is there are no clocks on the wall.
6. If something is not very predictable, forget it. You don't have to be right on every company. You have to make few good decisions in your lifetime. 
7. When you read annual report and find company worth 100b and sell for 35b, any further refining analysis would be a waste of time when what you should be doing is buying the stock. PetroChina it's like if somebody walked in the door and they weigh somewhere between 300 and 350 lbs, I might not know how much they weigh but I would know they were fat and that's all I'm looking for is something is financially fat.

## Philip Fisher

1. What are this company doing that his competitors aren’t doing yet?
2. The 15 points to look for in a Common Stock
   - Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?


## Peter Lynch

1. It is often easier to tell what will happen to the price of a stock than how much time will elapse before it happens. Doing what everybody else is doing at the
moment, and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do, is often the wrong thing to do at all.
2. You won't lose any money if you don't buy it. The only way to lose the money is you buy it and sell it low. 
3. Why you always make money when you buy a house and lose money when you buy a stock?
   - You spend couple months before you buy a house, research location, neighbor, house condition, even hire professional people to check VS you buy a stock so fast without look too much of the company.
   - You usually borrow money from bank to buy house, when housing market not go well, you still pay same amount every month. VS if you use margin account buy stock and price drop, you have to put more money or broker will sell your stock cheaply. 
   - You won't or can't sell your house if housing market crash and you usually hold the house couple years before you sell it. But you might sell your stock tomorrow without difficulty. 
   - Sell house, you need a truck to move VS Sell stock just few click.
   - You see less price info, commentary, top 10 price increase house, news and etc compare to stock. 
4. Five ways to imporve the earning. 
   - cut the cost
   - increase the price
   - try to sale at new market
   - try to sale more at existing market
   - Close, remove un-profit sections/business. 
5. Call/Email company you invest and ask questions. If they ignore you, just say you hold a lot of their stock by this broker. 

## Joel Greenblatt

1. Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a buring match.
You may live, but you're still an idiot.


## 自己的感悟

1. 投资 大公司 vs 小公司
大公司资产众多，极其复杂，很难研究透，非常考验能力圈。同时因为公司庞大，未来相对“稳定”？ 
小公司，初创公司简单，适合个人仔细研究，寻找其中价值。如果发现亮点，会有很高的回报。
2. 当交易成功/失败概率如下时(50/50,66/33,80/20), 连续出现**运气**不好的trade概率如下。所以通过基本面分析，提高hit rate（成功率），从而更好的handle连续的bad trades。因为当连续bad trades发生，你要么失去所有资产，要么丧失信心。而连续成功的交易会让你身体分泌肾上腺素，得意忘形，觉得自己无敌。从而放大交易的size（超过1%-2% ），一旦bad trade连续发生。势必结果很惨。

| bad trade in rows | 50/50 | 66/33 | 80/20 |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1                 | 1/2   | 1/3   | 1/5   |
| 2                 | 1/4   | 1/9   | 1/25  |
| 3                 | 1/8   | 1/27  | 1/125 |
| 4                 | 1/16  | 1/81  | 1/625 |
3. 基金是如何运作的？
- 当基金表现好或者牛市的时候：
股民都去买基金 -> 基金拿到股民的钱后，去买他们基金组合里对应的股票 -> 基金的买入促使股票上涨 -> 基金本身的价格变贵。
- 当基金对应的股票下跌或者熊市时：
基金价格便宜 -> 股民害怕，抛售基金（要求基金把钱还给自己） -> 如果基金没有现金偿还股民时，只能被迫卖出持有股票 -> 促使股价继续下跌 -> 基金价格继续下跌恶性循环。
4. 一个投资有三个理想条件，1. 本金少，2. 赢利多，3. 风险小，然而这三个条件，你最多只能满足其中两个。各种期权策略灵活组合最终目的是创造一个适合你投资标的的“平衡点”。
5. 最好的决定往往是在最困难的时候做出来的，最差的决定往往是在最顺利的时候做出来的。
6. Ark基金的看法：
ARK基金是有自己的选股思路和方法的，他们不是发现破坏性创新的公司就立刻买入，是等待公司摆脱生死存亡，马上进入高速发展的阶段再买入。因为这种选股理念，他们关注的很多是小公司，而且这个思路和彼得林奇，费雪有异曲同工之处。林奇不喜欢“cutting edge”的公司，强调选自己懂的公司。ARK的分析员很多是相关专业的从业人员，有很好的工科背景。我觉得这也是他表现能很成功的原因。  很遗憾的是，很多追ark的人并没有这样的专业背景，单纯的去抄作业。这样其实并不好。另外如果持有ark的人不懂ark，那么在发生崩盘的时候，这些不懂ark的人就会赎回，导致ark反而失去抄底的机会。这也是为什么我认为长期ark可能不一定有巴菲特那么成功。巴菲特并不希望入股贝克希尔的不停的交易，而是全权托付。  ARK的成长速度会慢下来的，因为当基金体量很小的时候，它可以买入这些小盘股，当基金越做越大，很多小公司她慢慢就没有办法考虑了。选对一只十倍小盘股，对整体投资组合的提升是很不错的。可是随着资金越来越多，她就需要挑选一些大点的，而且还能高速成长的好公司。这会对她的挑选眼光提出更高考验。另外她未来也许可以学巴菲特，有足够的魄力直接将看好的公司全盘买下，从而获得源源不断的公司增长。
7. What do I definitely not want to go to when I am young. (**Inversion Thinking**)
   - avoid comfort in any age. If you're comfortable, you're absolutely screwed.
   - hanging around or working with people who I don't admire
   - doing easy things and avoiding building career moats that you can compound and iterat off
   - neglecting or abusing your health
   - gaining liabilities in debt
   - toxic relationships
   - feedback less environments
