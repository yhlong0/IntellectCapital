1. I don't want to work all my life.
2. I don't want what my parents aspired for, which was job security and a house in the suburbs.
3. I don't like being an employee. I hated it when I worked hard all my life and the government took most of what I worked for.
4. I want to be free to travel the world and live in the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this.
5. I want to simply be free. I want control over my time and my life.
6. I want money to work for me.
7. Finding your path in life is your goal in life.
