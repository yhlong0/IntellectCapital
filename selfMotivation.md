8. A high school teacher ask Warren Buffett what the important things he will teach those students, Warren said when he at age 16, the only thing he think of is girl wasn't going out with him, so he was down to cars. Let's assume a genie appeared and offer any car you want tomorrow. And having heard the genie stories before, you say to the genie, "What's the catch?"， “Well, there is just one, the car you going to get tomorrow morning, is the only car you're ever going to get for the whole life.” What you gonna do knowing that's the only car you're going to have for the rest of your life? You read the owner's manual many times, keep it garaged, change oild twice as often as they tell you to do, keep tires inflated properly and etc. In other words, you make sure that this car of your dream at age 16 is still be the car of your dreams at age 50 or 60, because you treat it as the only one you'll ever get in your lifetime. And then I would suggest to your students that they are going to get exactly one mind and one body, and that's the mind and body they're going to have at age 40 and 50 and 60.
