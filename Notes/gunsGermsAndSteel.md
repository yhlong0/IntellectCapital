# Guns, Germs, and Steel

1. History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.
2. By enabling farmers to generate food surpluses, food production permitted farming societies to support full-time craft specialists who did not grow their own food and who developed technologies. Besides sustaining scribes and inventors, food production also enabled farmers to support politicians. Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian.
3. At least 5 million more years protohuman exist in Africa, if that counted for anything, then Africa enjoyed an enormous advantage. If it is true that modern humans arose in Africa around 100,000 years ago and spread to other continents, that would have wiped out any advantages accumulated elsewhere in the meantime and given Africans a new head start. Furthermore, human genetic diversity is highest in Africa; perhaps more-diverse humans would collectively produce more-diverse inventions. (Biology advantages is not the point)
4. Extra food increase the population, then it create different levels in society, specialization also increased. Eventually there will be military, animal domestication, especially horse, allow human move heavy goods, people rapidly over long distances and power to conquer other places. 
5. The reason transite to food production, foraging humans, have finite time and energy, shall I spend today hoeing garden predictably yielding food several months from now, or gathering shellfish, little meat today, or hunting deer possibly a lot of meat, but more likely nothing. 
6. People seek to maximize their return of calories, protein, in a way that yields the most return with greatest certainty in the least time for the least effort.
7. Denser populations of food producers enabled them to displace or kill hunter-gatherers by their sheer numbers. 
8. 植物需要依靠动物传播，所以它们进化出水果，让动物来吃。但是种子却不会被动物的消化系统破坏，另外种子很苦，也可以避免动物去吃。水果在种子不成熟前，果肉绿酸，难吃。等种子成熟以后，红甜美味吸引动物。
9. Seedlessness provide a good example of how human selection can completely reverse the original evolved function of a wild fruit. 
10. Some fruit and nut trees had the drawback of not starting to yield food until a least three years after planting. This prevent them domesticated early by human. 同理，当养成了种植习惯，才有可能开始种植有长期回报的植物。
11. Some societies will be more open to innovation, and some will be more resistant. The ones that do adopt new crops, livestock, or technology may thereby be enabled to nourish themmselves better and to outbreed, displace, conquer, or kill offf societies resisting innovation. 
12. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." -- Anna Karenina
13. In order to be happy, a marriage must succeed in many different respects: sexual attraction, agreement about money, child discipline, religion, and other vital issues. Failure in any one of those essential respects can doom a marriage even if it has all the other ingredients needed for happiness. 
14. To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage.
    - Diet, 10% food biomass conversion. As a result of this fundamental inefficiency, no mammalian carnivore has ever been domesticated for food. 
    - Growth Rate, gorillas and elephants take 15 years to reach adult size. 
    - Problems of Captive Breeding, don't like sex under watchful eyes of others. Male cheetahs need to chase female several days to get ovulate or to become sexually receptive. Vicunas camel has long and elaborate courtship ritual before mating.
    - Nasty Disposition. Keeping grizzly bear longer than one year would be suicidal. Zebras impossible to lasso with a rope. 
    - Tendency to Panic. Gazelles, blindly bashes itself against wall. 
    - Social Structure. Horse, dog maintain a well-developed dominance hierarchy among herd members. 


### 为什么人会选择冒着危险当军人或者警察，甚至愿意牺牲奉献自己的生命？

远古时期，人类社会主要是以围猎的方式生存，在这个时期没有富裕的食物，人人是“平等”的都必须努力打猎维持生存。人类文明进化的一步是学会种植和驯养动物，相比围猎，种植谷物和驯养的猪，鸡等等可以带来稳定可靠的食物，同时产生了额外的富余。这些富余的食物首先增加了人口数量和密度，另外进一步推动了文明的进化。富余食物可以让人“坐着”，避免四处奔波的生活，同时进化出了专业特长。专家们不用为食物操心，只需要专心制造工具，小独木舟等等去换取食物。另一方面，阶级也在这时产生。当一个部落的人数在百人以下时，大部分成员彼此都是相互认识或者有血缘亲戚关系，小群体是可以公平互相协作的运行。假想25个人的小部落某个人杀掉其中一个成员，并不被其他人追究，这种可能性非常低。当部落人口突破千人的时候，彼此互相认识的概率就开始下降，如何区分敌人和自己人，组织协作，就诞生了中央集权制。这些酋长，官员大多无需劳作，“偷窃”其他成员辛勤劳作的成果。享受食物，穿戴华丽的服饰珠宝，试想普通部落成员为何甘愿被剥削？或者作为统治阶级如何保证普通人不造反？
1. 返还部分剥削的食物，在丰收后组织庆典。
2. 以组织建造公共设施，比如灌溉系统，城墙防御，来分配税收。
3. 缴械普通人，只允许精英层掌控武力。这点在现代社会尤为明显，平民大众基本没有任何武装力量。
4. 创造意识形态，建立国家，宗教的概念，让管理层的“剥削”合理化。你上贡的食物不是单纯给酋长，牧师，是用来祭拜神灵。
其中创造共享的意识形态国家或者宗教，可以让没有血缘关系的个人更好的和平生活在一起，而不是互相残杀。另外这些意识形态也使人产生一种动机，减少了人类自私的本性。你的牺牲是响应酋长的号召，为了整个部落。最终以少数人的牺牲，换来整个社会成员的安定幸福的生活。教会非常善于操控人类的心理，让你捐赠，减少罪恶，当把这种“捐赠”做到极致，你或许甚至愿意牺牲你的生命。
