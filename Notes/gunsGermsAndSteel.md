# Guns, Germs, and Steel

1. History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.
2. By enabling farmers to generate food surpluses, food production permitted farming societies to support full-time craft specialists who did not grow their own food and who developed technologies. Besides sustaining scribes and inventors, food production also enabled farmers to support politicians. Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian.
3. At least 5 million more years protohuman exist in Africa, if that counted for anything, then Africa enjoyed an enormous advantage. If it is true that modern humans arose in Africa around 100,000 years ago and spread to other continents, that would have wiped out any advantages accumulated elsewhere in the meantime and given Africans a new head start. Furthermore, human genetic diversity is highest in Africa; perhaps more-diverse humans would collectively produce more-diverse inventions. (Biology advantages is not the point)
