# Guns, Germs, and Steel

1. History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.
2. By enabling farmers to generate food surpluses, food production permitted farming societies to support full-time craft specialists who did not grow their own food and who developed technologies. Besides sustaining scribes and inventors, food production also enabled farmers to support politicians. Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian.
3. At least 5 million more years protohuman exist in Africa, if that counted for anything, then Africa enjoyed an enormous advantage. If it is true that modern humans arose in Africa around 100,000 years ago and spread to other continents, that would have wiped out any advantages accumulated elsewhere in the meantime and given Africans a new head start. Furthermore, human genetic diversity is highest in Africa; perhaps more-diverse humans would collectively produce more-diverse inventions. (Biology advantages is not the point)
4. Extra food increase the population, then it create different levels in society, specialization also increased. Eventually there will be military, animal domestication, especially horse, allow human move heavy goods, people rapidly over long distances and power to conquer other places. 
5. The reason transite to food production, foraging humans, have finite time and energy, shall I spend today hoeing garden predictably yielding food several months from now, or gathering shellfish, little meat today, or hunting deer possibly a lot of meat, but more likely nothing. 
6. People seek to maximize their return of calories, protein, in a way that yields the most return with greatest certainty in the least time for the least effort.
7. Denser populations of food producers enabled them to displace or kill hunter-gatherers by their sheer numbers. 
8. 植物需要依靠动物传播，所以它们进化出水果，让动物来吃。但是种子却不会被动物的消化系统破坏，另外种子很苦，也可以避免动物去吃。水果在种子不成熟前，果肉绿酸，难吃。等种子成熟以后，红甜美味吸引动物。
9. Seedlessness provide a good example of how human selection can completely reverse the original evolved function of a wild fruit. 
10. Some fruit and nut trees had the drawback of not starting to yield food until a least three years after planting. This prevent them domesticated early by human. 同理，当养成了种植习惯，才有可能开始种植有长期回报的植物。
11. Some societies will be more open to innovation, and some will be more resistant. The ones that do adopt new crops, livestock, or technology may thereby be enabled to nourish themmselves better and to outbreed, displace, conquer, or kill offf societies resisting innovation. 
12. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." -- Anna Karenina
13. In order to be haapy, a marriage must succeed in many different respects: sexual attraction, agreement about money, child discipline, religion, and other vital issues. Failure in any one of those essential respects can doom a marriage even if it has all the other ingredients needed for happiness. 
14.
