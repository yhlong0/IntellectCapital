# Nonviolent Communication

1. Ahimsa
    - Do no harm
    - It's not what you do that counts, it's the quality of your attention.
    - The only way to resolve all violence is to give up your story.
2. NVC Process
    - Observe what is actually happening in a situation without introducing any judgement or evaluation
    - State how we feel when we observe this action, are we hurt, scared, joyful amused, irritated.
    - Say what needs are connected to the feelings we have identified. 
    - Immediately follow a very specific request. 
3. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged.
4. Moralistic(教育) judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don't act in harmony with our values. 
5. If my colleague is more concerned about details than I am, he is "picky and compulsive." On the other hand, if I am more concerned about details than he is, he is "sloppy and disorganized."
6. Analyses of otheres are actually expressions of our own needs and values. 
7. Classifying and judging people promotes violence. Comparisons are a form of judgment. 
8. Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language that blocks compassion. 
9. Learn to express your feeling, not opinion. "I feel like I'm married to a wall" vs "I am feeling lonely and wanting more emotional contact with you"
