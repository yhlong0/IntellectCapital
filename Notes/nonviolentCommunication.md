# Nonviolent Communication

1. Ahimsa
    - Do no harm
    - It's not what you do that counts, it's the quality of your attention.
    - The only way to resolve all violence is to give up your story.
2. NVC Process
    - Observe what is actually happening in a situation without introducing any judgement or evaluation
    - State how we feel when we observe this action, are we hurt, scared, joyful amused, irritated.
    - Say what needs are connected to the feelings we have identified. 
    - Immediately follow a very specific request. 
3. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged.
4. Moralistic(说教的) judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don't act in harmony with our values. 
5. If my colleague is more concerned about details than I am, he is "picky and compulsive." On the other hand, if I am more concerned about details than he is, he is "sloppy and disorganized."
6. Analyses of otheres are actually expressions of our own needs and values. 
7. Classifying and judging people promotes violence. Comparisons are a form of judgment. 
8. Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language that blocks compassion. 
9. Learn to express your feeling, not opinion. "I feel like I'm married to a wall" vs "I am feeling lonely and wanting more emotional contact with you." First statement is more likely to be heard as criticism than invite for connecting our feelings. A husband is hurt and discouraged and doesn't respond, thereby confirming his wife's image of him as a wall(self fulfilling prophecies)
10. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or touching without mixing in any evaluating. This is the highest form of human intelligence.
11. Expressing out vulnerability can help resolve conflicts
12. When hearing a negative message, sense our own feelings and needs or sense others' feelings and needs
13. "You disappointed me by not coming over last evening." VS "I was disappointed when you didn't come over, because I wanted to talk over some things that were bothering me." First attributes responsibility for his disappointment solely to another person's action. Second traces his feeling of disappointment to his own unfulfilled desire. 
14. The more we are able to connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately. 
15. If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met. 
16. Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want. Vague language contributes to internal confusion. 
17. We are often not conscious of waht we are requesting.(e.g. A man at DFW airport keep saying the train is the slowest, instead he want to express he is in rush and his wife could comfort him by saying we still have enough time to catch the flight)
18. Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker's feelings and needs. Instead of saying why don't you go and get a haircut, you might say I am worried that your hair is getting so long and might keep you from seeing things, how about a haircut. 
19. It's a request instead of demands if the speaker shows empathy toward the other person's needs.
