# Nonviolent Communication

1. Ahimsa
    - Do no harm
    - It's not what you do that counts, it's the quality of your attention.
    - The only way to resolve all violence is to give up your story.
2. NVC Process
    - Observe what is actually happening in a situation without introducing any judgement or evaluation
    - State how we feel when we observe this action, are we hurt, scared, joyful amused, irritated.
    - Say what needs are connected to the feelings we have identified. 
    - Immediately follow a very specific request. 
3. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged.
4. Moralistic(说教的) judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don't act in harmony with our values. 
5. If my colleague is more concerned about details than I am, he is "picky and compulsive." On the other hand, if I am more concerned about details than he is, he is "sloppy and disorganized."
6. Analyses of otheres are actually expressions of our own needs and values. 
7. Classifying and judging people promotes violence. Comparisons are a form of judgment. 
8. Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language that blocks compassion. 
9. Learn to express your feeling, not opinion. "I feel like I'm married to a wall" vs "I am feeling lonely and wanting more emotional contact with you." First statement is more likely to be heard as criticism than invite for connecting our feelings. A husband is hurt and discouraged and doesn't respond, thereby confirming his wife's image of him as a wall(self fulfilling prophecies)
10. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or touching without mixing in any evaluating. This is the highest form of human intelligence.
11. Expressing out vulnerability can help resolve conflicts
12. When hearing a negative message, sense our own feelings and needs or sense others' feelings and needs
13. "You disappointed me by not coming over last evening." VS "I was disappointed when you didn't come over, because I wanted to talk over some things that were bothering me." First attributes responsibility for his disappointment solely to another person's action. Second traces his feeling of disappointment to his own unfulfilled desire. 
14. The more we are able to connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately. 
15. If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met. 
16. Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want. Vague language contributes to internal confusion. 
17. We are often not conscious of waht we are requesting.(e.g. A man at DFW airport keep saying the train is the slowest, instead he want to express he is in rush and his wife could comfort him by saying we still have enough time to catch the flight)
18. Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker's feelings and needs. Instead of saying why don't you go and get a haircut, you might say I am worried that your hair is getting so long and might keep you from seeing things, how about a haircut. 
19. It's a request instead of demands if the speaker shows empathy toward the other person's needs. 
20. It is often frustrating for someone need empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or "fix-it" advice. Author daughter think she is ugly, what she wants is empathy, not reassurance. Ask before offering advice or reassurance.
21. Husband: What good does talking to you do? You never listen. Are you feeling unhappy because you are needing to be heard? Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking. 
22. I'm frustrated because I'd like to be clearer about what you are referring to. Would you be willing to tell me what I've done that leads you to see me in this way? When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs. 
23. Don't pull any of that psychology crap on me! All criticism, attack, insults vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message. Behind those intimidated messages, there is a need unmet, don't take it personally, try to figure it our what they need. 
24. It's harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources. These faculty members had remembered to empathize with their dean(dean worry about time use) as well as with their students.
25. We "say a lot" by listening for other people's feelings and needs. 
26. Never to put your 'but' in the face of an angry person. A man who been taking drugs, is holding a knife to threathen a young woman at drug detox center. 
27. It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us.
28. Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen, what bores the listener bores the speaker too.
29. Find everything you "have to" and translate it to you "choose to", add a reason, I choose to ... because I want ...
30. We are never angry because of what someone else did. Other person's behavior might be a stimulus, the cause of anger lies in our thinking -- in thoughts of blame and judgment. When we judge others, we contribute to violence.
31. A conversation between prisoner, thinking about you own need, instead of blaming other is very important to reduce the anger. 
32. Steps to expressing anger: Stop, breathe, -> Identify our judgmental thoughts -> Connect with our needs -> Express our feelings and unmet needs. 
33. The wife had twice overdrawn checking account whereupon the husband took control and no longer let her write checks. 
    - figure out real need, lead two sides to this caring and respectful connection:
        - Ask wife what her husband needs? She said he obviously doesn't want me to spend any money.(This is a strategy, not need)
        - Ask wife try again, she said he is just like his fater, reluctant to spend money. (Making an analysis)
        - Ask husband what you need? He said when comes to money, she's totally irresponsible. (His use of diagnosis)
        - Real need: feeling scared because he have a need to protect his family economically.
    - Have the needs been heard?
        - Ask wife repeat what husband really need, she said, just because I overdrew a couple of times, it doesn't mean I'm going to contiune doing it.(When we have pain built up over many years, it can get in the way of our ability to hear clearly)
        - People often need empathy to ease the pain before they are able to hear. I sense that you're feeling hurt and you need to be trusted that you can learn from past experience.
    - Once connection build, create strategies that resolve the conflict will be much easier
34. Avoid the use of language that implies wrongness. 
35. Needs vs Strategies: needs contain no reference to anybody taking any particular action. On the other hand, strategies refer to specific actions that specific people may take. 
36. Use a present language to request: Would you be willing to ...
37. When they say "no", they're saying they have a need that keeps them from saying "yes" to what we are asking.
38. Punishment includes judgmental labeling and the withholding of privileges
39. Instead of punishment, thinking two questions: What do I want this person to do that's different from what he or she is currently doing? What do I want this person's reasons to be for doing what I'm asking?
40. How to say "thank you" in NVC: This is what you did, this is what I feel, this is the need of mine that was met.
41. Anything that is worth doing is worth doing poorly.
