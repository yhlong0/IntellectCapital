# The Richest Man In Babylon

1. Our acts can be no wiser than our houghts. Our thinking can be no wiser than our understanding.
2. A man's wealth is not in the purse he carries. A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it. 
3. Every gold piece you save is a slave to work for you. Every copper it earns is its child that also can earn for you. If you would become wealthy, then what you save must earn, and its children must earn, that all may help to give to you the abundance you crave. Keep no less than a tenth no matter how little you earn. Pay yourself first. 
4. Don't trust the knowldege of a brickmaker about jewels.
5. First get you an army of golden slaves and then many a rich banquet may you enjoy without regret.(delay gratification)
6. Opportunity is a haughty(傲慢) goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared.
