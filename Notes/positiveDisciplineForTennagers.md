# Positive Discipline For Teenagers

1. Stress is represented by the space between how life should be and how life is.
2. You can also reduce your stress when you understand that who your teens are today is not who they will be forever.
3. Teens often lie because they love you and they want to protect you. They want to be able to do what they do without hurting your feelings. Other times, they lie to protect themselves--from your harsh opinions and possibly harsh actions. 
4. Connecting before correcting
5. Respect yourself and show your teen that you have needs and wants and a life to live. Remember that you are an important person too. We find that parents think they should give up their needs and their lives until the kid are gone. If you parent that way, your teens will probably think the world revolves around them, even more than they already do.
6. When use reward/punish method, you are controlling your kids. Teen won't learn responsibilities. They learn not to get caught, to manipulate for bigger rewards, or to refuse compliance when the reward/punishment no longer matters. 
7. The permissive style of parenting, short-term parenting robs teenagers of learning the life skills of self-reliance(依赖) and resiliency. Instead of learning that they can survive pain and disappointment, and even elarn from it, children grow up extremely self-centered, convinced that the world and their parents owe them something and they are entitled to whatever they want. 
8. We often equate mistakes with failure rather than with opportunities to learn.
9. Four hints for effective follow through:
    - Keep comments simple, concise, and friendly. 
    - In response to objections, ask, "Waht was our agreement?"
    - In response to further objections, shut your mouth and use nonverbal communication. Point to your watch, Smile knowingly, less is more, **the less you say, the more effective you will be**.
    - When your teen concedes, say "Thank you for keeping our agreement".
10. Listening is the primary ingredient of communication, not talking, and it is the least developed parenting skill.
11. Sometimes you get the best results by forgetting about behavior and focusing on the relationship. 
12. Better a bruised knee than bruised courage. A broken knee can mend, but broken courage lasts forever. 
13. Teen four mistaken goals of behavior: (mix with to seek excitement)
    - To get attention or special service
    - To have power over others
    - To seek justice through revenge
    - To be left alone without anyone expecting anything of them
