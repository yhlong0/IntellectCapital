# The Science of Self-Discipline

> It says that when an individual's mind begins telling them that they are physically or emotionally maxed out, in reality they have only pushed themselves to 40% of their full capacity. Most of us have no clue about our true physical and mental limitations. It is mostly the people who seek out intense challenges that subsequently learn discipline and mental strength, while the rest go about their comfortable lives without any idea of their full capabilities. 
> Box breathing, regain control by focusing on their breath, 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out. repeating until you can feel your heart rate slow down and normalize.
> 10X Rule, If you sit in a car for only 10 minutes, you won't prepare for the ride, but how would you prepare for the car ride differently if you knew it was going to be 100 minutes long? Set targets that are 10 times more than wht you think you want, and take 10 times greater action than you think it is necessary to accomplish those targets. 
> 10 Minute Rule, If you want to quit something beneficial, hold just 10 more minutes, if you want to buy something, wait at least 10 minutes before getting it. If you're doing something productive you might keep doing it for five minutes longer after you first feel the urge to quit. Then the follwing time you go for an extra six or seven minutes, and so on. exercise discipline for a few minutes longer and you'll steadily build better self-discipline with each escalation. 


### Notes

- For whatever goal you want to achieve, there is discomfort along that path. Self-discipline drives you through this discomfort and allows you to achieve and attain.
- It may not be surprising that self-discipline has a biological basis. This means, like any of your muscles, it can be trained and also depleted and worn out. The latter is know as willpower fatigue. This is a good thing because it gives you a blueprint to deal with your self-discipline--you can increase it, and you can put yourself in situations to conserve it. It also means you can affect your self-discipline in positive ways through daily behaviors and habits. 
- We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. 
- "Exercise your self-control" is an accurate way of thinking about your ability to be disciplined in the face of tempation, as that ability can be built up if you consistently exercise it by making healthier choices and it can also be stripped down by constantly giving in to unhealthy pleasures. 
- The subjects who were forced to resist the sweets had depleted their willpower in doing so, and so when they were asked to engage in another difficult task they were already wron out. Our brains have to make survival the top priority, however, modern age temporarily low blood sugar aren't life-threatening conditions, but your brain is going to enter into survival mode, **a green light for instant gratification and binge eating, as well as a myriad of other failures of self-discipline.**
- Stress diverts energy away from the prefrontal cortex and causes us to focus more on shor-term outcomes, which influences us to make regrettable decisions. 
- There is a specific goal in mind, a specific outcome that is supposedly worth the work and willpower. Knowing the exact outcome you want is an essential part of having self-discipline. 
- People were most incentivized to work by the feeling of making consistent progress toward a meaningful goal. 
- Three main categories of motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. 
  - autonomy, pursue their own ideas while following their own intuition.
  - mastery, Anybody who is highly driven by the idea of mastering their craft will be much more willing to make sacrifices and be disciplined in their pursuit than the typical person.
  - purpose, the feeling or intention that we can have an impact on the world. 
- The first cause for action is **chance**. when you encountering an old friend and learning that he have become extremely successful, while you may be happy for them, you possible feel abit of envy or regret. Those feelings can motivate you to pursue your own goals.
- **nature**, you might turn off netflix, because you have a natural need to sleep. 
- **complusions(冲动，强迫)**, feels motivated to take despite it being contrary to desires or rationality. You want to be fit and healthy, but still eat an unhealthy meal or skip a workout. 
- **habits**, once a habit does become second nature, breaking it will be difficult. 
- **anger and passion**,somebody might be damage their own integrity in order to hurt someone else. 

### 感悟

养成一个好习惯，比如锻炼身，需要一个开始，这个开始应该足够简单，足够短，让你无法寻找借口不开始。一旦开始，你需要的就是一点点增加目标，不让这个习惯断掉。毁掉一个习惯也非常容易，喝醉一次酒，身体不适为“借口”，停止一次，之后你可能会继续给自己找借口去减少锻炼次数，最后这个花费许久努力养成的习惯就会被毁掉。
