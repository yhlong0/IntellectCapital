1. Success is determined not so much by the size of one's brain as it is by the size of one's thinking.
2. There is nothing either good or bad except that thinking makes it so.

7. It's just an arm, Sure, two are better than one. But they just cut off my arm. My spirit is one hundred percent intact. I'm really grateful for that. As an excellent golfer, the right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.

12. To think big, we must use words and phrases that produce big, positive mental images. 
13. Use positive words to outline plans: Here is some good news. We face a genuine opportunity.
14. Eliminate the word impossible from your thinking and speaking. Impossible is a failure word.
15. It isn't so much what you know when you start that matters. It's what you learn and put to use after you open your doors that counts most.--Woman opens 3-4 hardware stores
