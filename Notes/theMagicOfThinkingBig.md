# The Magic of Thinking Big

1. Success is determined not so much by the size of one's brain as it is by the size of one's thinking.
2. There is nothing either good or bad except that thinking makes it so.
3. When you believe I-can-do-it, the how-to-do-it develops. 
4. Vaccinate yourself against excusitis, the disease of the failures. 
5. The four most common forms of excusitis: **health, intelligence, age and luck**.
6. I'm going to live until I die and I'm not going to get life and death confused. While I'm on this earth I'm going to live. Why be only half alive? Every minute a person spends worrying about dying is just one minute that fellow might as well have been dead. 
7. It's just an arm, Sure, two are better than one. But they just cut off my arm. My spirit is one hundred percent intact. I'm really grateful for that. As an excellent golfer, the right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.
8. If a productive time a person has is from 20 - 70, even you are 30,40 years old, you still have many years ahead. Start now!
