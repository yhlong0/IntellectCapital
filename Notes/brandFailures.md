1. Pepsi define itself as "the drink of youth", this is very successful and dangerous move. On one hand, the future is youth, on the other hand, it is not friendly to old people.
2. Pepsi start catch up, it is Coca effective distribution which kept it ahead. But people more prefer Pepsi. 
3. Coke always be defeated when it came down to blind taste. Pepsi is a bit sweater, but this is not fair for Coke's brand. This brand has more meaning.
4. When introduce the New Coke, old production line was stopped, take away things people has before will create massive bad feeling.
5. Don't clone your rivals. 
6. Successful brands don't have 'trademarks'. They have 'lovemarks' instead. Brand loyalty means emotional attached. 
7. Don't be scared to U-turn, if you made mistake, fixed asap. After coke bring back the original, it actually better sales then before. 
8. Don't exaggrate the ads, if product not match hype, you will have trouble.
9. Name is important, make sure it is easy to pronuce and asscoiate with good stuff. 
10. Have the affordable product. 
11. Corporate presumption and disregard for market realities. Design a car based on customer needs, don't design a car first then try to find a market to sell. 
12. Branding isn't about products, it is about perception.
13. As Henry Ford remarked on the launch of his Model T, "If I had asked the customer, he would have asked for a faster horse."
14. Detergent too strong and destory the clothes. **Test products in all conditions. **
15. Pepsi has hard time to make customer distinguish his brand and coca cola, coke is brown red color. And use blue for brand is just a poor choice.
