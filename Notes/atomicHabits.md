# Atomic Habits

Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years. The quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you'll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. 

### The power of tiny gains
Bike team like to improve, they only earn one Medal in last 100 years. They hire someone and start making small change in below area.
  - thin tire
  - racing suits
  - test different type massage gel, see which one better
  - wash hand, keep health
  - pillow which one let them sleep better

1. Aggregation of marginal gains, 1% improvement in nearly everything that you do. Small improvements can actually added up to significant change 
in a relative short period of time. 1% better each day, 1.01^365 = 37.78 37 times better at the end of the year. The way to reach this goal is by 
obtaining better habits.

2. Imagine an ice cube in front of you. The room is 25F, slowly room begins to heat up. 26,27,....31 nothing has happened. Then 32 the ice begins to melt, A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change -- break through this plateau!

3. If you're a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you're on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don't change, it's not going to end well. Conversely, if you're broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you're on the path toward financial freedom--even if you're moving slower than you'd like.

4. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. 
  
5. A study done by Yale regarding psychology of aging. One group has positive view of aging and another group has negative view of aging. At the end, those 
who has positive view live 7 years longer. When you have positive view, you gonna more likely to work out, eat health vs negative view people will say what's 
point to exercising I'm going to get sick anyway. 

### How Habits Shape your Identity(and Vice Versa)

1. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. System are about the processes that lead to those results， implement a system of continuous small improvements.
2. Result, Outcomes( Processes, Actions ( Identity, Belief, Mindset ) ) )
3. Three layers of behavior change: 
    - a change in your outcomes
    - a change in your processes
    - a change in your identity
    
4. The belief/identity we hold, drive the behavior, actions and at the end the result. In Yale example, people has postivie belief, they take positive actions 
and thus they get positive result. 

5. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this. It's something very different to say I'm the type of person who is this. 
    - When offered a smoke, "No thanks, I'm trying to quit" VS "No thanks, I'm not a smoker"
    - "I want to be skinny(outcome) and if I stick to this diet, I'll be skinny(process)" VS "I am a health/workout person, I never eat junk food."
    - The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
    - The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner
    - The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. 

6. When your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be. I want to become the person never miss the work out. -> take actions -> good result.

7. Building better habits isn't about littering your day with life hacks, It's not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about *having something*, they are about *become someone*.

8. A shift in mindset leads to a shift in daily choices, and shift in daily choices leads to significantly better results in the long-run.
9. Doesn't so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life? This question make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom, in reality, the two complement each other. Habits do not restrict freedom, they create it. Without good financial habits, you will always struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. If you're always forced to make decisions about simple tasks--when should I work out, when do I pay the bills, then you have less time for freedom. Making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity. Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future. 

### The Science of How Habits Work
> Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward

1. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
2. Cravings are the motivational force behind every habits.
3. Response is the actual habit you perform, which can tak the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior
4. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. 
5. How to create a good habit or Break a bad habit? 
    - (Cue): Make it obvious/invisible.
    - (Craving): Make it attractive/unattractive.
    - (Response): Make it easy/difficult. 
    - (Reward): Make it satisfying/unsatisfying.
6. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.


### Cue 
1. The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.(Japen Pointing-and-Calling operator), If you want to cut back on your junk food habit, say out loud, "I'm about to eat this cookie, but I don't need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health." Saying out loud, increase the odds that you'll actually do it.
2. Two most common cues are time and location, implementation intentions leverage both of these cues. I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
3. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.(Denis Diderot a poor french writer for Encyclopedie, once he bought a scarlet robe, he has to keep "upgrading" everything)
4. **Habit stacking**, One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.
5. Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. One in, One out. 
6. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that your will notice when the time comes to act.

### Craving(Environment)
1. Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, B = f(P, E)
2. A small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do, you don't have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.
3. Trying to eat healthier? Try a new grocery store, you may find it easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn't automatically know where it is located in the store.
4. The way to improve willpower is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. 
5. A high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. 
6. Foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more. The precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. *We've gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.*
7. It is the anticipation of a reward--not the fulfillment of it--that gets us to take action.
8. Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. Netflix + cycling, 10 burpees + check facebook.
9. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. 
10. 

### Ruthless(无情) Elimination

Priority not Priorities. Don't have multiple first things. When coming to building better habits and changing behavior, we have to be ruthless about the things we
focus on. You brain will get fatigued, the will power depletes. **Decision fatigue** or **Ego Depletion** The more decision you make, the more willpower and 
focus get fatigued.

### Simplify the 25-5 rules

Write 25 things you want to achieve, circle top 5 things. Only first 5 things you will do and they are your priorities, the rest 6 to 25 never do under 
any circumstance list. Those just not best use of our time, so forget about it. 

5. The 3 R's of habit formation

Reminder(Trigger) -> Routine -> Reward -> Reminder

1. The cue or tirgger that starts the habit. (Put on your running shoes)
2. The action you take, the habit itself. (Running)
3. The benefit you gain from doing the habit. (Never sick, health)

Once it cycle multiple times, it becomes habit. Leverage the trigger!
- associate new habit with existing habit. (Everyday you drink coffee, everyday you mediate before drinking the coffee.)
- 2 mins rule, there is no habit that we're gonna work on that takes less than 2 minutes to do. **But nearly any habit can be started in under 2 minutes.**
For example, you want to build a running, focus on the first 2 mins, put on running shoes, get out the door and I lock the door. And If you do just that, 
It doesnt' matter if you take another step, but what you find the motivation often comes after starting. Motivation will come as a result of doing some small bit 
of work. Make it so easy that you can't say no.  

6. Precommitment & Implementation Intentions

Business want employee to get flu shot. Send different message will make people more likely to do it.
- you need to get flu shot
- you already scheduled the flu shot on this day
- you already scheduled the flu shot on this day at this time. **4X more likely do it.**

Write a sentence saying you gonna do work out at this time, at this places. 

7. Keystone Habits

How do you decide where to start? Simplicity, Elimenating. A keystone habit is a routine or ritual that ripples into the rest of your life. Use work out as exmpale,
Once you start work out, have a period high focus time, sleep better, eat health, at no point you plan to build better nutrious plan or better focus, but those are
come as you start work out. This is your keystone habits.

8. Environment Design(Deisign for laziness)

If you like popcorn and want to stop yourself eat that, put it in somewhere hard to get, because of your laziness, you will stop yourself eating it. Design your 
environment so that the default action the lazy behavior is a better choice. I never see a person consistently stick to positive habits in a negative 
environment(smoking). 

9. The Seinfeld(90年代最成功的喜剧之一) Strategy. 

Someone ask Seinfeld how to become a great comic? He said, to be a great comic, you need to write better jokes, and the secret to writing better jokes is to write
every day. Get a wall calendar, each day if you stick with your behavior, mark it X(Github green dot). At begining you might just get it here and there, eventually 
you gonna get a string going five six seven in row, you got a chain! At that point, all you need to do is don't break the chain.
