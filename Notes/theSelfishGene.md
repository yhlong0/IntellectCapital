# The Selfish Gene

1. The best way to look at evolution is in terms of selection occurring at the lowest level of all. 
2. By controlling and coordinating the contractions of muscles, natural selection favoured animals that became equipped with sense organs, which translate physical events in the outside world into pulse code of the neurones.
3. In a large and complex system of rivalries, removing one rival from the scene does not necessarily do any good. Other rivals may be more likely to benefit from his death than oneself. This is the kind of hard lesson that has been learned by pest-control officers.
4. The gene pool will become an evolutionarily stable set of jenes, defined as a gene pool that cannot be invaded by any new gene. 
5. Even though the mother would prefer the little brother to die rather than the big brother, she may still give the food to the little one, because the big one is unlikely to die anyway. Runts has same set of gene, so parents would like to help them to spread their gene. 
6. 最开始细胞长的一样大小，各有一半基因，结合产生下一代。后来一些细胞更大，有更多营养，所以在之后会有优势（卵子）。另一类分化利用这种，让自己更小，更灵活，数量特别多（精子）。
7. Individuals on the edge of the herd are especially vulnerable, a sensible individual will try to keep his domain of danger as small as possible, avoid being on the edge of the herd. 
8. Faith means blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence. 
9. If you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.
10. For divoce lawyer and fund managers, it is non zeros sum game. Divoce lawyer make each party become enemy, their total assets lost after ripe by lawyer. Same thing will happen between funds manager and their client. Funds manager has less contribute.
