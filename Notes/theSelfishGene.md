# The Selfish Gene

1. The best way to look at evolution is in terms of selection occurring at the lowest level of all. 
2. By controlling and coordinating the contractions of muscles, natural selection favoured animals that became equipped with sense organs, which translate physical events in the outside world into pulse code of the neurones.
3. In a large and complex system of rivalries, removing one rival from the scene does not necessarily do any good. Other rivals may be more likely to benefit from his death than oneself. This is the kind of hard lesson that has been learned by pest-control officers.
4. The gene pool will become an evolutionarily stable set of jenes, defined as a gene pool that cannot be invaded by any new gene. 
5. Even though the mother would prefer the little brother to die rather than the big brother, she may still give the food to the little one, because the big one is unlikely to die anyway. Runts has same set of gene, so parents would like to help them to spread their gene.
