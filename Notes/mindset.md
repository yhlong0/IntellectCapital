# Mindset

1. It's not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest. 
2. An individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. With practice, training, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. 
3. Growth mindset: everyone can change and grow through application and experience. 
4. In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means you're not smart or talented. If you were, you wouldn't need effort. In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented. 
5. If you only go through life doing stuff that's easy, shame on you. 
6. Use one exam grade, ask teacher how they treat student. Performance cannot be based on one assessment. You cannot determine the slope of a line given only one point, as there is no line to begin with. A single point in time does not show trends, improvement, lack of effort, or mathematical ability.
7. People with the fixed mindset try to repair their self-esteem after a failure is by assigning blame or making excuses. 
8. The idea of trying and still failing--of leaving yourself without excuses--is the worst fear within the fixed mindset.
9. The growth mindset does allow people to love what they're doing--and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties.
10. Remember, test scores and measures of achievement tell you where a student is, but they don't tell you where a student could end up. 
11. The effort kids simply thought the difficulty meant "Apply more effort or try new strategies." They didn't see it as a failure, and they didn't think it reflected on their intellect.
