# The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work

1. It is not wise to stay in a bad marriage for the sake of your children. It is clearly harmful to raise kids in a home that is consumed by hostility. A peaceful divorce is preferable to endless marital warfare. 
2. [Enduring vulnerabilities](https://www.restoredhopecounselingservices.com/blog/2021/4/6/how-enduring-vulnerabilities-are-affecting-your-marriage)
3. Positive sentiment override fuels the flames of romance because it offers the best protection against feeling adversarial toward your spouse. 
4. Betrayal is any act or life choice that doesn't prioritize the commitment and put the partner before all others. E.g. emotionally distant, siding with a parent against one's mate, direspecting the partner, and breaking significant promises. Betrayal lies at the heart of every failed relationship. 
5. Repair attempt, any statement or action--silly or otherwise--that prevents negativity from escalating out of control. 
6. How I Predict Divorce?
    - Harsh Start-up, I've tried letting you do it(housekeeping) on your own, and nothing got done for a month. Blaming, criticism, sarcasm, negative and accusatory. She's saying the problem isn't the housekeeping, it's him. She might feel frustration, but the way she expresses herself will be a major roadblock to resolving their differences.
    - The Four Horsemen, Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling.
    - Flooding, psychologically and physically overwhelmed. When your spouses's negativity is so intense. The more often you feel flooded by your spouses's criticism or contempt, the more hypervigilant you are for cues that your spouse is about to blow again.
    - Body status change, heart rate increase, sweating more, hormonal changes(adrenaline) -- It is  fear reactions, the same way you facing tiger. You become fight or flight, just like animal. You won't be able to think rationally, the ability to process information is reduced, hard for creative problem solving and your sense of humor go out the window. 
    - Failed repair attempts, the more contemptuous and defensive are, the harder it is to hear and respond to a repair. 
    - Bad Memories, happy marriage remember happy moments, bad marriage rewritten history and remember more bad time. 


7. A good Complaint template: 
    - Here's how I feel, (I'm really angry)
    - About a specific situation (You didn't sweep last night)
    - Here's what I need/want/prefer (Could you do it now)
8. A Criticism is expresses negative feelings or opinions about the other's character or personality:
    - Why are you so forgetful? I hate having to **always** sweep the kitchen floor when it's your turn. *You just don't care*.
    - You always, you never, what's wrong with you?
    - Why can't you ever remember anything? I told you a thousand times to [do something], and you didn't, you're always so careless.
9. Contempt arises from a sense of superiority over one's partner. Name-calling, eye-rolling, mockery, and hostile humor. It conveys disgust and couples who are contemptuous of each other are morelikely to suffer from infectious illnesses(colds, flu) than other people. e.g. If I leave you alone for fifteen minutes, then you think you'll be motivated to jump up and do something? sneering.
10. If one person attack nasty, the other one will defend himself/herself. **Defensiveness** in all its guises just escalates the conflict. it is a way of blaming your partner. "Innocent victim", why are you picking on me? What about all the good things I do? When wife said it is hard for her to wash her car, her husband just got outrages and climbs farther up his high moral ground, telling her how well he takes care of his vehicle and implying she's spoiled for not doing the same. 
11. Stonewalling, the less responsive he is, the more she yells. Eventually he gets up and leaves the room. Rather than confronting, he disengages. Doesn't give eye contact, nod his head, or say something like "yeah" or "Uh" this sort of casual feedback. 
12. The key to divorce-proofing is not simply handle your disagreements but how you engage with each other when you're not fighting. The foundation of love is to know your partner, build love map.
