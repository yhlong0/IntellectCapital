# The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work

1. It is not wise to stay in a bad marriage for the sake of your children. It is clearly harmful to raise kids in a home that is consumed by hostility. A peaceful divorce is preferable to endless marital warfare. 
2. [Enduring vulnerabilities](https://www.restoredhopecounselingservices.com/blog/2021/4/6/how-enduring-vulnerabilities-are-affecting-your-marriage)
3. Positive sentiment override fuels the flames of romance because it offers the best protection against feeling adversarial toward your spouse. 
4. Betrayal is any act or life choice that doesn't prioritize the commitment and put the partner before all others. E.g. emotionally distant, siding with a parent against one's mate, direspecting the partner, and breaking significant promises. Betrayal lies at the heart of every failed relationship. 
5. Repair attempt, any statement or action--silly or otherwise--that prevents negativity from escalating out of control. 
6. How I Predict Divorce?
    - Harsh Start-up, I've tried letting you do it(housekeeping) on your own, and nothing got done for a month. Blaming, criticism, sarcasm, negative and accusatory. She's saying the problem isn't the housekeeping, it's him. She might feel frustration, but the way she expresses herself will be a major roadblock to resolving their differences.
    - The Four Horsemen, Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling.
    - Flooding, psychologically and physically overwhelmed. When your spouses's negativity is so intense. The more often you feel flooded by your spouses's criticism or contempt, the more hypervigilant you are for cues that your spouse is about to blow again.
    - Body status change, heart rate increase, sweating more, hormonal changes(adrenaline) -- It is  fear reactions, the same way you facing tiger. You become fight or flight, just like animal. You won't be able to think rationally, the ability to process information is reduced, hard for creative problem solving and your sense of humor go out the window. 
    - Failed repair attempts, the more contemptuous and defensive are, the harder it is to hear and respond to a repair. 
    - Bad Memories, happy marriage remember happy moments, bad marriage rewritten history and remember more bad time. 


7. A good Complaint template: 
    - Here's how I feel, (I'm really angry)
    - About a specific situation (You didn't sweep last night)
    - Here's what I need/want/prefer (Could you do it now)
8. A Criticism is expresses negative feelings or opinions about the other's character or personality:
    - Why are you so forgetful? I hate having to **always** sweep the kitchen floor when it's your turn. *You just don't care*.
    - You always, you never, what's wrong with you?
    - Why can't you ever remember anything? I told you a thousand times to [do something], and you didn't, you're always so careless.
9. Contempt arises from a sense of superiority over one's partner. Name-calling, eye-rolling, mockery, and hostile humor. It conveys disgust and couples who are contemptuous of each other are morelikely to suffer from infectious illnesses(colds, flu) than other people. e.g. If I leave you alone for fifteen minutes, then you think you'll be motivated to jump up and do something? sneering.
10. If one person attack nasty, the other one will defend himself/herself. **Defensiveness** in all its guises just escalates the conflict. it is a way of blaming your partner. "Innocent victim", why are you picking on me? What about all the good things I do? When wife said it is hard for her to wash her car, her husband just got outrages and climbs farther up his high moral ground, telling her how well he takes care of his vehicle and implying she's spoiled for not doing the same. 
11. Stonewalling, the less responsive he is, the more she yells. Eventually he gets up and leaves the room. Rather than confronting, he disengages. Doesn't give eye contact, nod his head, or say something like "yeah" or "Uh" this sort of casual feedback. 
12. The key to divorce-proofing is not simply handle your disagreements but how you engage with each other when you're not fighting. The foundation of love is to know your partner, build love map.
13. A tendency to turn toward your partner is the basis of trust, emotional connection, passion, and a satisfying sex life. 
14. Before you reply defensively to your partner, pause for a moment and search for a bid underneath your partner's harsh words. 
15. When someone is sad, usually it's because they feel that they have lost someone or something. 
16. There's a big difference between "Sheesh, you're a lousy driver! Slow down before you kill us!" and "I know you enjoy driving fast, but I get really nervous. Could you please slow down?"
17. "Hey, there's poop all over the backyard. We agreed you'd clean up after Banjo. I'm really upset about this. Would you please clean it up?" vs "Hey, there's poop all over the backyard. This is all your fault. I just knew you'd be irresponsible about that dog. I should never have trusted you about it in the first place.
18. Make statements that start with "I" instead of "You". 
19. "You are not listening to me" vs "I would like it if you'd listen to me."
20. "You are careless with money" vs "I want us to save more"
21. "You just don't care about me" vs "I'm feeling neglected."
22. If your words focus on how you feel rather than on accusing your spouse, your discussion will be far more successful. 
23. Describe what is happening. Don't evaluate or judge. Intead of "You never watch the baby" say, "I seem to be the only one chaing after kid today."
24. Be clear about your positive need. Don't expect your partner to be a mind reader. Instead of "You left the kitchen a total mess" say, "I'd appreciate it if you would clean your stuff off the kitch table." Instead of "Would you take care of the baby for once?" say, "Please change Emmy's diaper and give her a bottle."
25. Don't expect your partner auto react with great sweetness once you begin to soften your start-up, don't fall into the trap of giving up and escalating the conflict. Continue to broach topics gently, and eventually you will see a change.
26. If you frequently have the experience of being calmed by your spouse, you come to associate him or her with feelings of relaxation rather than stress. This auto increases the positivity in your relationship.
27. If your heart rate exceeds 100/minute, you won't be able to hear what your spouse is trying to tell you. Take a 20 mins break.
28. Emotional injuries, the culprit is not what you were fighting about but how you were fighting. Examining what tends to go on between you during a disagreement.
29. A child is a grenade. When you have a baby, you set off an explosion in your marriage, and when the dust settles, your marriage is different from what it was. Not better, necessarily; not worse, necessarily; but different.
30. An important part of putting your spouse first and building this sense of solidarity is to not tolerate any contempt toward your spouse from your parents. 
31. A dream was the root cause of gridlock. 
    - express understanding of the dream and be interested in learning more about it.
    - actively enable the dream
    - become a part of the dream
