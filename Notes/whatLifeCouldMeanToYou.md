# What Life Could Mean to You

1. Contribution is the true meaning of life.
2. We see roadways and buildings,experience of life, These results have all been left by men who contributed to human welfare. What has happened to those who never cooperated, who gave life a different meaning, who asked only, "What can I get out of life?" They have left no trace behind them. 
3. No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from trauma, but we make out of them justwhat suits our purposes. We are self-determined by the meaning we give to our experiences; and there is probably something of a mistake always involved when we take particular experiences as the basis for our future life. Meaning are not determined by situations, but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations. 
4. It is therefore of supreme importance that children should be trained and encouraged in cooperation, should be allowed to find their own way amongst children of their own age, in common tasks and games. The spoiled child only interested in himself, When he comes near adult age and his error first occurred, he ceased training himself for responsibility and independence. 
5. Anger is a device to dominate a person or a situation.
