# What Life Could Mean to You

1. Contribution is the true meaning of life.
2. We see roadways and buildings,experience of life, These results have all been left by men who contributed to human welfare. What has happened to those who never cooperated, who gave life a different meaning, who asked only, "What can I get out of life?" They have left no trace behind them. 
3. No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from trauma, but we make out of them justwhat suits our purposes. We are self-determined by the meaning we give to our experiences; and there is probably something of a mistake always involved when we take particular experiences as the basis for our future life. Meaning are not determined by situations, but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations. 
4. It is therefore of supreme importance that children should be trained and encouraged in cooperation, should be allowed to find their own way amongst children of their own age, in common tasks and games. The spoiled child only interested in himself, When he comes near adult age and his error first occurred, he ceased training himself for responsibility and independence. 
5. Anger is a device to dominate a person or a situation. 
6. People have always disliked individuals who had very noticeable physical peculiarities, without knowing it, they were judging them as less fitted for cooperation. This was a great mistake, their drawbacks were therefore overemphasized and they became the victims of popular supersition.
7. We must never treat a Symptom or a single expression: we must discover the mistake made in the whole style of life, in the way the mind has interpreted its experiences, in the meaning it has given to life, and in the actions with which it has answered the impressions received from the body and from the environment.
8. Tears and complaints(water power) can be an extremely capable weapon for disturbing cooperation and reducing others to a condition of slavery. 
9. Inferiority feelings are the cause of all improvements in the position of mankind. Science can arise only when people feel their ignorance and their need to foresee the future. It is the result of the strivings of human beings to improve their whole situation, to know more of the universe and to be able to control it better.
10. Our interest in life comes mainly from our lack of certainty. If we were all sure, if we knew everything, there would no longer be discussions or discoveries. 
11. A melancholiac(忧郁) could not remain melancholiac if he remembered his good moments and his successes. He must say to himself "all my life I was unfortunate" and select only those events which he can interpret as instances of his unhappy fate.
12. When you think negatively, you style of life alteres, your memories also will alter, you will remember different incidents, or you will put a different interpretation on the incidents you remembers. e.g. Other people always humiliate me.
