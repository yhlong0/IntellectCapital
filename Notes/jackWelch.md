# Jack straight from the gut

1. I wanted to create a company where people dare to try new things, where people feel assured in knowing that only the limits of their creativity and drive, their own standards of personal excellence, will be the ceiling on how far and how fast they move. 
2. Get out of the pile--If I had just answered my boss questions, it would have been tough to get noticed. Bosses usually have answers in mind when they hand out questions. They're just looking for confirmation. To set myself apart from the crowd, I thought I had to think bigger than the questions posed. I wanted to provide not only the answer, but an unexpected fresh perspective. 
3. When people make mistakes, the last thing they need is discipline. It's time for encouragement and confidence building. The job at this point is to restore self-confidence. Arrogant people who refuse to learn from their mistakes have to go. If we're managing good people who are clearly eating themselves up over an error, our job is to help them through it. No one should ever be surprised when they are asked to leave. 
4. How much my success would depend on the people I hired, the importance of getting the right people, if I found someone great, it made all the difference in the world. Eventually, I learned that I was really looking for people who were filled with passion and a desire to get things done. 
5. Jack will fire anyone can't perform well, because his success is depends on how good his army.
6. GE credit is much easy bussiness, less captial spend, less people but much better profit.
