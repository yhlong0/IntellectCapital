# Mindset

1. It's not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest. 
2. An individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. With practice, training, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. 
3. Growth mindset: everyone can change and grow through application and experience. 
4. In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means you're not smart or talented. If you were, you wouldn't need effort. In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented. 
5. If you only go through life doing stuff that's easy, shame on you. 
6. Use one exam grade, ask teacher how they treat student. Performance cannot be based on one assessment. You cannot determine the slope of a line given only one point, as there is no line to begin with. A single point in time does not show trends, improvement, lack of effort, or mathematical ability.
7. People with the fixed mindset try to repair their self-esteem after a failure is by assigning blame or making excuses. 
8. The idea of trying and still failing--of leaving yourself without excuses--is the worst fear within the fixed mindset.
9. The growth mindset does allow people to love what they're doing--and to continue to love it in the face of difficulties.
10. Remember, test scores and measures of achievement tell you where a student is, but they don't tell you where a student could end up. 
11. The effort kids simply thought the difficulty meant "Apply more effort or try new strategies." They didn't see it as a failure, and they didn't think it reflected on their intellect. 
12. Are there sports you always assumed you're bad at? Well, maybe you are, but then maybe you aren't. It's not something you can know untila you've put in a lot of effort. 
13. For people with growth mindset, the number one goal was forgiveness. As one woman said, I'm no saint, but i knew for my own peace of mind that I had to forgive and forget. He hurt me but I had a whole life waiting for me and I'll be damned if I was going to live it in the past. 
14. The growth mindset says your partner's qualities can be developed. All--you, your partner, and the relationship are capabale of growth and change. 
15. Every marriage demands an effort to keep it on the right track; there is a constant tension...between the forces that hold you together and those that can tear you apart. 
16. If you have a troubled relationship with a parent, whose fault is it? It's my responsibility to enlighten my parents, improve their thinking, be patient as they did for me when I was young. 
17. For children, don't judge, just teach. It's a learning process. 
18. You really studied for your test and your improvement shows it. You read the material over several times, you outlined it, and test yourself, it really worked!
19. I like the way you tried all kinds of strategies on that math problem until you finally got it. 
20. That homework was so long and involved. I really admire the way you concentrated and finished it. 
21. Everyone learns in a different way. Let's keep trying to find the way that works for you. 
22. Don't praise for speed and perfection, they are the enemy of difficult learning. Avoid like: "Wow, you did that so quickly!" or "Look, you didn't make any mistakes!"
23. Abusive parents often don't understand that children's crying is a signal of their needs. Babies can't stop crying on command. Don't judge the child as disobedient, willful, or bad for crying.
24. Why people loved teaching? Teaching was about watching something grow before you very eye.
25. Schools are for students learning. Well, why aren't they just as much for teachers' learning?
26. Concrete plan--plans you can visualize--about when, where, and how.
27. When an anger-provoking situation arises, you have to matter-of-factly *tell them how it makes you feel*.
28. It's amazing once a problem improves, people often stop doing what caused it to improve. But changes doesn't work that way, these changes have to be supported or they can go away faster than they appeared. 
29. The journey to growth mindset, the first step is to embrace your fixed mindset, let's face it, we all have some of it.
30. Learn and help learn, What are the oppotunites for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me? As you think of opportunities, form a plan of When, where and how will I embark on my plan?
