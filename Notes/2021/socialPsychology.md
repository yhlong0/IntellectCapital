# Social Psychology

1. **Social psychology** is a science that studies the influences of our situations, with special attention to how we view and affect one another. It is study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another. 
2. There is an objective reality out there, but we always view it through the lens of our beliefs and values. example: a football game lead to fight, people from different team view this differently. 
3. The label reflects the judgment:
    - a quiet child as "bashful" or "cautious"
    - someone engaged in warfare as "terrorist" or "freedom fighter"
4. Randomly sample 1200, you will be 95 percent certain to draw out between 47 percent and 53 percent.(error margin of 3 percentage points or less)
5. A young monk was once rebuffed when asking if he could smoke while he prayed. Ask a different question, advised a friend: Ask if you can pray while you smoke. 
6. The **spotlight effect** means seeing ourselves at center stage, thus intuitively overestimating the extent to which others' attention is aimed at us.
7. We overestimate the visibility of our social blunders and public mental slips. When we trigger the library alarm or accidentally insult someone, we may be mortified("Everyone thinks I'm a jerk"). But research shows that what we agonize over, others may hardly notice and soon forget. 
8. If you want to encourage someone (or yourself!), it's better if your praise is specific ("You're good at math") instead of general ("You're great") and if your kind words reflect true ability and performance("You really improved on your last test") rather than unrealistic optimism("You can do anything"). Feedback is best when it is true and specific. 
9. Self-control is worth 10 times as much as self-esteem. 
10. We are eager to verify our beliefs but less inclined to seek evidence that might disprove them, **confirmation bias**
11. Mood subconsciously influence how closely we observe the outside around us, with negative mood improving attention and memory.(From biologo evolution?)
12. When researcher implanted a belief and then ask participants to explain why it is true, even researcher later totally discredited the initial information, the false belief still survived about 75% intact--**belief perserverance**. Beliefs can grow their own legs and survive discrediting. 
13. Unhappy couples usually offer internal explanations for negative acts("She was late because she doesn't care about me"). Happy couples more often externalize("She was late because of heavy traffic"). 
14. Hateful attitudes spawn violent behavior.
15. To change habits through persuasion, we must alter people's attitudes toward specific practices.
16. Civilization advances by extending the number of operations which we can perform without thinking about them.
17. Behavior determines attitudes. We sometimes stand up for what we believe. We also come to believe in what we stand up for. 
18. It's not that we put bad apples in a good barrel. We put good apples in a bad barrel. The barrel corrupts anything that it touches. 
19. To sense how other people are feeling, let your own face and body mirror their expressions.
20. **Overjustification effect**: Rewarding people for doing what they already enjoy may lead them to attribute their action to the reward. This would undermine their self-perception that they do it because they like it.
21. Men everywhere tend to be most attracted to women whose age and features suggest peak fertility. No matter what age, they all like mid-20s women. 
22. It is easiest to abuse someone who is distant or depersonalized. When you shock the people you can't see, you are much easier to do so. Internet bad comments, Air attack vs shot someone in front of you. Nuclear weapon button, if president wants to fire it, he has to kill one human being with his own hands, he might never push the button. 
23. Slippery slope, after you had complied with initially reasonable-seeming orders from a supposed authority. External behavior and internal disposition can feed each other, sometimes in an escalating spiral. Shock people from low voltage -> high voltage. 
24. Ordinary people without any particular hostility can become agents in a terrible destructive process. When we understand the ordinariness of extraordinary evil, we will be less surprised by evil, less likely to be unwitting contributors to evil, and perhaps better equipped to forestall evil.
25. Our desire to be liked, and the second from our desire to be right.
26. Central route to persuasion: pay attention to the message -> Comprehend it -> Believe it -> Remember it -> Behave accordingly -> Action.
27. Referendum supporters were all people I either liked or regarded as experts, I used a simple heuristic--friends and experts can be trusted--and voted accordingly. We all make snap judgements using such heuristics and take the easy peripheral route and accept the message without much thought.
28. Fear-then-relief is a highly effective approach. Excuse me, Haven't you lost your wallet? Everyone immediately checked, to their relief, wallet was still in place. Then sell Christmas cards for a charity. 30% more people bought the card. 
29. Others' presence will arouse or energize people, it boost performance on easy tasks and hurt performance on difficult tasks.
30. Unequal status breeds prejudice.
31. Stereotypes represent cognitive efficiency. They are energy-saving schemes for making speedy judgments and predicting how others will think and act. We judge people in outgroups more quickly. 
32. The "disfigured" women had misinterpreted mannerisms and comments they would otherwise not have noticed. 
33. Sleep deprivation reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain responsible for self-control. In individuals prone to violence and aggression, poor sleep can lead to violence and aggresssion. 
34. Comparison is the thief of joy.
35. Venting to reduce anger is like using gasoline to put out a fire.
36. Whether we are judging ourselves or others, negative information carries more weight because, being less usual, it grabs more attention.
37. Coldness, disillusionment, and hopelessness are better predictors of divorce than arguing.
38. After illegally parking, looks like a ticket under your windshield wiper, you pick it up and then much relieved to discover it is only an ad. Then a student approaches you ask to spend 15 mins to answering questions. People whose fear had just turned to relief agree willingly. 
39. Make the group small, in a small commons, each person feels more responsible and effective.
40. Increased contact predicted decreased prejudice. 
41. Leaders may create a threatening external enemy as a technique for building group cohesiveness. George Bush, 9/11 and Iraq war. 
42. Depression/Happiness is often contagious. 
43. Depressed moods cause negative thinking, vice verse.  negative Experiences -> self-focus and self-blame -> depressed mood -> cognitive and behavioral consequences -> negative experiences
44.
