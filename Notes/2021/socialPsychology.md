# Social Psychology

1. **Social psychology** is a science that studies the influences of our situations, with special attention to how we view and affect one another. It is study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another. 
2. There is an objective reality out there, but we always view it through the lens of our beliefs and values. example: a football game lead to fight, people from different team view this differently. 
3. The label reflects the judgment:
    - a quiet child as "bashful" or "cautious"
    - someone engaged in warfare as "terrorist" or "freedom fighter"
4. Randomly sample 1200, you will be 95 percent certain to draw out between 47 percent and 53 percent.(error margin of 3 percentage points or less)
5. A young monk was once rebuffed when asking if he could smoke while he prayed. Ask a different question, advised a friend: Ask if you can pray while you smoke. 
6. The **spotlight effect** means seeing ourselves at center stage, thus intuitively overestimating the extent to which others' attention is aimed at us.
7. We overestimate the visibility of our social blunders and public mental slips. When we trigger the library alarm or accidentally insult someone, we may be mortified("Everyone thinks I'm a jerk"). But research shows that what we agonize over, others may hardly notice and soon forget.
