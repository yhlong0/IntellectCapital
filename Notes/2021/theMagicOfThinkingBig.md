# The Magic of Thinking Big

1. Success is determined not so much by the size of one's brain as it is by the size of one's thinking.
2. There is nothing either good or bad except that thinking makes it so.
3. When you believe I-can-do-it, the how-to-do-it develops. 
4. Vaccinate yourself against excusitis, the disease of the failures. 
5. The four most common forms of excusitis: **health, intelligence, age and luck**.
6. I'm going to live until I die and I'm not going to get life and death confused. While I'm on this earth I'm going to live. Why be only half alive? Every minute a person spends worrying about dying is just one minute that fellow might as well have been dead. 
7. It's just an arm, Sure, two are better than one. But they just cut off my arm. My spirit is one hundred percent intact. I'm really grateful for that. As an excellent golfer, the right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.
8. If a productive time a person has is from 20 - 70, even you are 30,40 years old, you still have many years ahead. Start now!
9. Action cures fear. Indecision, postponement, on the other hand, fertilize fear. 
10. There is some kind of action for any kind of fear and hesitation only enlarges magnifies the fear. 
11. Hotel check-in, the way to think he really isn't mad at me, I was just the scapegoat. The poor fellow may be in bad trouble with his wife or business. Underneath he's probably a very nice guy. Most folks are. Hold your fire, the way to win in situations like this is to let the other fellow below his stack and then forget it.
12. To think big, we must use words and phrases that produce big, positive mental images. 
13. Use positive words to outline plans: Here is some good news. We face a genuine opportunity.
14. Eliminate the word impossible from your thinking and speaking. Impossible is a failure word.
15. It isn't so much what you know when you start that matters. It's what you learn and put to use after you open your doors that counts most.--Woman opens 3-4 hardware stores
16. Eagerly accept the opportunity to do more. It's a compliment to be asked to take on a new responsibility. 
17. Pay twice as much and buy half as many. Commit this answer to memory, then practice it. Apply it to hats, suits, shoes, socks, coats. 
18. People do more for you when you make them feel important, It pays to make "little" people feel like big people. It pays to make "big" people feel even bigger. 
19. People wanted the company to pay him more and then he would produce more. But this is not how the system works. You don't get a raise on the promise of better performance; you get a raise only by demonstrating better performance. You can't harvest money unless you plant the seeds that grow money. And the seed of money is service. 
20. What do they expect for $X a week? -- is stuck at $X a week. 
21. Thinking in terms of now gets things accomplished, but thinking interms of someday or sometime usually means failure.
22. Salvage something from every setback.
23. The quickest way to the end is to retire and do nothing. Every human being must keep an interest in life just to keep living. 
24. When employees doing something wrong:
    1. talk to them privately
    2. praise them for what they are doing well.
    3. point out the one thing at the moment that they could do better and I help them find the way.
    4. praise them again on their good points.
25. Success and the ability to lead others--that is, getting them to do things they wouldn't do if they were not led--go hand in hand. 
26. Whoever is under a man's power is under his protection too. We never should have hired this man in the first place because he's not cut out for this kind of work. But since we did, the least I could do was help him to relocate. By helping that employee relocate before he left us built up a feeling of job security in everyone in my department. I let them know by example that no one gets dumped on the street as long as I'm here.
