# The Dhandho Investor

1. Dhandho is all about the minimization of risk while maximizing the reward. Heads, I win; tails, I don't lose much!
2. As prices and occupancy collapsed, Manilal stepped in and made his play. He was on the hunt for three years. He patiently waited for the right deal to materialize. Classically, his story is all about "Few Bets, Big Bets, Infrequent Bets."
3. You're looking for a mispriced gamble. That's what investing is. And you have to know enough to know whether the gamble is mispriced. That's value investing.
4. The balance sheet tells us the amount of capital deployed in the business. The income and cash flow statements tell us how much they are earning off that capital. 
5. Wall Street sometimes gets confused between risk and uncertainty, and you can profit handsomely from that confusion. The Street just hates uncertainty, and it demonstrates that hate by collapsing the quoted stock price of the underlying business. 
    - High risk, low uncertainty
    - High risk, high uncertainty
    - Low risk, high uncertainty, **the only one interest to us.**
    - Low risk, low uncertainty, is loved by Wall Street, and stock prices of these securities sport the highest trading multiples. Avoid them.
6. Archery is all about being singularly focused on the target. If the archer can't fixate on just the target, success is likely to be elusive.
