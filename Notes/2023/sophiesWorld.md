# Sophie's World

1. You can't experience being alive without realizing that you have to die, but it's just as impossible to realize you have to die without thinking how incredibly amazing it is to be alive.
2. When basic needs have been satisfied, philosophers think there still be something that everybody needs. Man cannot live by bread alone, everyone needs to figure out who we are and why we are here.
3. The world itself becomes a habit in no time at all. It seems as if in the process of growing up we lose the ability to wonder about the world. Philosophers try to restore that life is a huge mystery, they never get quite used to the world.
