# Sophie's World

1. You can't experience being alive without realizing that you have to die, but it's just as impossible to realize you have to die without thinking how incredibly amazing it is to be alive.
2. When basic needs have been satisfied, philosophers think there still be something that everybody needs. Man cannot live by bread alone, everyone needs to figure out who we are and why we are here.
3. The world itself becomes a habit in no time at all. It seems as if in the process of growing up we lose the ability to wonder about the world. Philosophers try to restore that life is a huge mystery, they never get quite used to the world.
4. In current times, scientists have discovered that atoms can be broken into smaller, there has to be a "minimal part" of which nature consists. Democritus did not have access to modern electronic apparatus. His only proper equipment was his mind. Nothing can change and nothing can come out of nothing, nothing is ever lost, then nature must consist of infinitesimal blocks that can join and separate again.
5. Fatalism(宿命论) is the belief that whatever happens is predestined.
6. Knowing what you don't know is also a kind of knowledge. The stupidest thing she knew was for people to act like they knew all about things they knew absolutely nothing about.
7. Most schoolmasters are satisfied with what little they know or boast of knowing a whole lot about subjects they haven't the faintest notion of. A philosopher knows that in reality, he knows very little. That is why he constantly strives to achieve true insight.
