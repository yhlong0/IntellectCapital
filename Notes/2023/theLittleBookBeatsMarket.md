# The little book that still beats the market

1. 1 percent ownership means that you would be entitled to 1 percent of the future earnings of the entire business. 
2. Can the value of largest company in US change that much within the same year? No, it makes no sense. Why? I don't really have to know, I just have to know that they do, maybe people go nuts a lot. And this create a lot of opportunities for rational people.
3. Return on captial: 10k store return 1k per year vs 20k store return 1k per year, the first one might be a better company with special advantage that keeps competitors from destroying the ability to earn above-average profits. If you stick to buy good companies and at bargain prices(at prices that give you a high earnings yield), you can end up systematically buying many of the good companies that crazy Mr.Market has decided to literally give away. 
4. Artemus Ward: "It ain't the things we don't know that get us in trouble, it's the things we know that ain't so."
5. Why mgaic formula still work? Because it doesn't work all the time, and it might not work for years. Most people has short investment time horizon, after a year or two of performing worse than the market averages, or lower returns than their friends, most people give up. Same thing for professional money managers, their investors just leave or probably lost their job. 
6. Think it's easy to stick with a formula that hasn't worked for several years? Do you think the typical reaction goes something like "I know this hasn't worked for a long time" or "I know I just lost a lot of money," but "let's keep doing what we're doing!"? I assure you, it is not.
7. The formula is systematically helping us find above-average companies that we can buy at below-average prices. 
    1. List 3500+ companies sort by return on captial from high to low(1 - 3500).
    2. List 3500+ companies sort by earnings yield from high to low(1 - 3500).
    3. Combine the rankings, sort from low to high. 
8. The opportunity to invest profits at high rates of return is very valuable.
