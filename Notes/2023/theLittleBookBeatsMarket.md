# The little book that still beats the market

1. 1 percent ownership means that you would be entitled to 1 percent of the future earnings of the entire business. 
2. Can the value of largest company in US change that much within the same year? No, it makes no sense. Why? I don't really have to know, I just have to know that they do, maybe people go nuts a lot. And this create a lot of opportunities for rational people.
3. Return on captial: 10k store return 1k per year vs 20k store return 1k per year, the first one might be a better company. If you stick to buy good companies and at bargain prices(at prices that give you a high earnings yield), you can end up systematically buying many of the good companies that crazy Mr.Market has decided to literally give away. 
4. Artemus Ward: "It ain't the things we don't know that get us in trouble, it's the things we know that ain't so."
5. Why mgaic formula still work? Because it doesn't work all the time, and it might not work for years. Most people has short investment time horizon, after a year or two of performing worse than the market averages, or lower returns than their friends, most people give up. Same thing for professional money managers, their investors just leave or probably lost their job.
