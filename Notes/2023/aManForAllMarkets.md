# A Man for All Markets

1. The surest way to get rich is to play only those gambling games or make those investments where I have an edge. 
2. Acknowledgment, applause, and honor are welcome and add zest to life but they are not ends to be pursued. What matters is what you do and how you do it, the quality of the time you spend, and the people you share it with.
3. When first start at Las Vegas, I had calculated 50-500 to be the highest we could bet safely with our 10k bankroll. Betting only at a level at which I was emotionally comfortable and not advancing until I was ready, enabled me to play my system with a calm and disciplined accuracy. This lesson from the blackjack tables would prove invaluable thorughout my investment life-time as the stakes grew ever larger. 
4. Sometimes, the Ten-Count System had shown moderately heavy losses mixed iwth "lucky" streaks of the most dazzling brilliance. I learned later that this was a characteristic of a random series of favorable bets. And I would see it again and again in real life in both the gambling and the investment worlds. 
5. I stop play when moderated win to avoid notice, also stop playing after a moderate loss in cases of cheating that we hadn't detected. Mathematically, interruptions didn't matter, because my lifetime of playing was just one long series of hands, and chopping it into sessions and playing them at various times and in various casinos should not affect my edge, nor the long-run amount I could expect to win. 
6. Gambling is investing simplified. Both can be analyzed using mathematics, statistics, and computers. Each requires money management, choosing the proper balance between risk and return. Betting too much, even though each individual bet is in your favor, can be ruinous.
