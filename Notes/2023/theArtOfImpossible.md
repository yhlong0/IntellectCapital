# The Art Of Impossible

1. Motivation is what gets you into the game; learning is what helps you continue to play; creativity is how you steer; and flow is how you turbo-boost the results beyond all rational standards and reasonable expectations. That is the real art of the impossible. Welcome to the infinite game.
2. Flow: refers to those moments of rapt attention and total absorption when you get so focused on the task at hand that everything else disappears. Action and awareness merge. Your sense of self vanishes. Time passes strangely. And performance just soars.
3. The act of telling someone about your goal gives you the feeling that the goal's already been achieved. It releases the dopamine you're supposed to get afterward, prematurely. Once you've already felt that high, it's difficult to get back up for the hard fight required to actually earn it.
4. On the one hand, you need a high hard goal, on the other end, you need a daily to-do list.
5. If you think you can or you think you can't, well, you're right.
6. Early-stage passion doesn't look like late-stage passion. We usually imagine LeBron James hard-scowling his way to some backboard rattling(篮板抖动的声音) thunder dunk, or Einstein wild-haired at the blackboard, brain rattling off(快速回忆，回想) equations. Actually, for LeBron, early-stage passion looked like a little kid standing in front of a big hoop, trying to get his shots to drop. On the front end, passion is nothing more than multiple curiosities coupled with a few wins. 
7. The ultimate goal may be to "get obsessed, stay obsessed," but our journey begins with "get curious, stay curious."
8. Passion isn't always pleasant. Quite often, passion feels like frustration on the inside and looks like obsession from the outside. You must learn to tolerate an enormous amount of anxiety and overwhelm. Passion doesn't make us gritty, it makes us able to tolerate all the negative emotions produced by grit.
