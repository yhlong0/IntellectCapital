# Secrets of the Millionaire Mind

1. If you're not doing as well as you'd like, all that means is there's something you don't know. You thought you knew pretty well everything, but your bank account said something different. So you better began to listen, how rich people think.
2. If things aren't going well in your outer life, it's because things aren't going well in your inner life. 
3. Have you noticed how some people have a lot of money and then lose it? On the outside, it looks like bad luck, a bad economy, a lousy partner, whatever, on the inside, if you come into big money when you're not ready for it on the inside, the chances are your wealth will be short-lived and you will lose it.
4. Money is a result, wealth is a result, health is a result, illness is a result, your weight is a result. We live in a world of cause and effect. 
5. Have you ever heard someone assert that a lack of money was a bit of a problem? A lack of money is never, ever a problem. A lack of money is merely a symptom of what is going on underneath.  
6. When you see other people make a lot of money and you come up with negative thoughts, or resentment about the person, before the energy took you over, cancel the thought, and drown out that voice of resentment. Turn around and say you rock! you should've got more money, good for you, you're incredible and you deserve it. The problem is not other people got rich, the problem is you, your opinions make no difference to rich people's happiness or wealth, but rich people do make a difference to your happiness and wealth. Thoughts enter your mind and be empowering or disempowering to your happiness and success. 
7. Never have a ceiling on your income, if you choose to get paid for your time, you are pretty much killing your chances for wealth. Talk to your boss, get paid by the specific result, commission. percentage of revenue. 
8. If you want to create wealth, it is imperative that you believe that you are at the steering wheel of your life, especially your financial life. 
9. Never complain, because you complain that your life is so crappy, shut up.. and don't stand near me! Negative energy is infectious, **I promise for the next month, to not complain at all, not just out loud, but in my head as well**. don't blame others, no need to justify or give excuses. 
10. If your goal is to be comfortable, chances are you'll never get rich. But if your goal is to be rich, chances are you'll end up mighty comfortable.
11. The purpose of our lives is to add value to the people of this generation and those that follow.
12. If you want to get rich, focus on making, keeping, and investing your money. If you want to be poor, focus on spending your money.
13. Don't bother trying to get negative people to change, That's not your job. Your job is to use what you've learned to better yourself and your life. Be the model, be successful, be happy, then maybe--they'll see the light in you and want some of it. Energy is contagious. If you can remain true to your values while others around you are full of doubt and even condemnation, you'll grow faster and stronger. Practice reframing other people's negativity as a reminder of how not to be. The more negative they are, the more reminders you have. Don't tell them this, just do it without condemning them for how they are. If you begin to judge, criticize and put them down for who they are and what they do, then you are no better than them.
14. Birds of a feather flock together.
15. The size of the problem is never the issue--what matters is the size of you! If you have a big problem in your life, all that means is that you are being a small person! Stop focusing on the size of your problems and start focusing on the size of you!
16. Any money you find or receive should enthusiastically be celebrated. "I'm a money magnet, Thank you!" This goes for money you find on the ground, for money you get as a gift, the universe is set up to support you(outside) and give you more money if your mind believes you are a money magnet(inside).
