# The Power Of A Positive No

1. Nos needs to be nice.
2. At the heart of the difficulty in saying No is the tension between exercising your power and tending to your relationship.
    - Attack: we say no poorly
    - Accommodate: we say yes when we want to say no
    - Avoid: we say nothing at all
3. Saying No means, first of all, saying Yes! to yourself and protecting what is important to you.
4. The first yes expresses your interests, and internal focus(Boss, my family needs me and I intend to spend the holidays with them), The second say No asserts your power(I will not be working during weekends and holidays), The third say Yes to further your relationship, external focus. (I propose we find a new arrangement that gets the necessary work done in the office while I spend the time I need with my family). Balance power and relationship.
5. The key to positive no is respect.
