# The Power Of A Positive No

1. Nos needs to be nice.
2. At the heart of the difficulty in saying No is the tension between exercising your power and tending to your relationship.
    - Attack: we say no poorly
    - Accommodate: we say yes when we want to say no
    - Avoid: we say nothing at all
3. Saying No means, first of all, saying Yes! to yourself and protecting what is important to you.
4. The first yes expresses your interests, and internal focus(Boss, my family needs me and I intend to spend the holidays with them), The second say No asserts your power(I will not be working during weekends and holidays), The third say Yes to further your relationship, external focus. (I propose we find a new arrangement that gets the necessary work done in the office while I spend the time I need with my family). Balance power and relationship.
5. The key to positive no is respect.
6. The fisherman teaches samurai, you should never strike out of anger. Do not react out of anger, take a deep breath and focus on your purpose, what you really want.
7. Go to the balcony, take a time-out, listen to your emotions, and uncover your interests, need and values.
8. Saying no could end in two paths, Plan A - acceptance, Plan B - backup, work on your Plan B, and turn fear into confidence. Plan B is not punishment or outlet for your frustration and anger. It is simply what you are going to do to help make sure your interests are respected even if the other does not cooperate. 
9. Zen master with a group of students, pick one student, drink tea I will beat you with this stick, if you don't drink that cup of tea, I will beat you with this stick. -> Build a winning coalition(You have a group of students, you can fight the bad boss together) or take away the stick from the Zen master.
10. If the other's reaction to our No is to hurt or threaten us, our first instinct may be to hurt them back, A more effective strategy is to neutralize the impact of their behavior, don't hit Zen master back, just take away the stick, simply remove their ability to attack you. Difficult customer who makes an unreasonable demand, if you say no, the customer gets angry and goes over your head to your boss. Speak to your boss in advance and explain, and ask your boss to refer the customer politely back to you. And give your customer your boss number.
11. Never take a person's dignity, it is worth everything to them and nothing to you. People could be a jerk or criminals, but for your own sake, safety, and interest, at least respect them as a human(hostage negotiators).
12. How to respect? Listen to understand, not to refute. Ask clarifying questions, acknowledge the other's point of view, let them know you value them, and surprise them with recognition.
    - Let me make sure I understand what you are saying
    - If I hear you right, you are saying that...
    - Help me understand if I hear you correctly...
    - Acknowledge their point without conceding yours.
14. Replace "But" with "Yes...And", Your price is way too high. But look at our quality... -> Yes, you're right, And if you consider our quality, you'll find that they are very reasonable for the value being delivered. 
15. Stick to the facts, Avoid words: should, always, everything. When situation X happens, I feel Y.., Because I want or need Z.
16. I make it a personal policy never to lend money to friends.
17. When people invite you to a party, I have another commitment or plan.
18. **Not now**, when customers ask to build a feature, if not now, when? I can't say, we'll have to see. If you need an answer right now, the answer is No.
19. I prefer to decline rather than do a poor job.
20. When two kids fight, "Hold on/Whoa/Wait a minute!/Timeout"
21. As you close one door, open another, invent options for mutual gain. Suggest a problem-solving process, if ... then, not now, later,
22. Make your request clear, feasible, and respectful.
23. Curve of acceptance: Avoidance -> Denial -> Anxiety -> Anger -> Bargaining -> Sadness -> Acceptance
24. Repeat your no and be consistent and persistent. President asks the servant to wake up, he is taking a nap and left strict orders not to be disturbed, I am the president wake him up. I am sorry, I work for xxx, not for you.
    - This doesn't work for me.
    - No thanks
    - I am not comfortable doing that
    - I'm sorry, but I'm not interested.
25. Educate, Ask reality-testing questions, use logical consequences, warn, don't threaten.
26. Help me understand your concerns, where does this proposal not meet your needs?
27. Use the "Acceptance Speech Test", another side might ask tough questions, and you need to prepare to answer those before encountering it. Most likely criticisms and best responses to criticisms.
28. After you say no, replenish your goodwill account, for example, you take away the kid's phone so he can focus on homework, after he did that, a treat with the family to celebrate, and remind him that discipline is not a personal rejection.
