# The Power Of A Positive No

1. Nos needs to be nice.
2. At the heart of the difficulty in saying No is the tension between exercising your power and tending to your relationship.
    - Attack: we say no poorly
    - Accommodate: we say yes when we want to say no
    - Avoid: we say nothing at all
3. Saying No means, first of all, saying Yes! to yourself and protecting what is important to you.
4. The first yes expresses your interests, and internal focus(Boss, my family needs me and I intend to spend the holidays with them), The second say No asserts your power(I will not be working during weekends and holidays), The third say Yes to further your relationship, external focus. (I propose we find a new arrangement that gets the necessary work done in the office while I spend the time I need with my family). Balance power and relationship.
5. The key to positive no is respect.
6. The fisherman teaches samurai, you should never strike out of anger. Do not react out of anger, take a deep breath and focus on your purpose, what you really want.
7. Go to the balcony, take a time-out, listen to your emotions, and uncover your interests, need and values.
8. Saying no could end in two paths, Plan A - acceptance, Plan B - backup, work on your Plan B, and turn fear into confidence. Plan B is not punishment or outlet for your frustration and anger. It is simply what you are going to do to help make sure your interests are respected even if the other does not cooperate. 
9. Zen master with a group of students, pick one student, drink tea I will beat you with this stick, if you don't drink that cup of tea, I will beat you with this stick. -> Build a winning coalition(You have a group of students, you can fight the bad boss together) or take away the stick from the Zen master.
10. If the other's reaction to our No is to hurt or threaten us, our first instinct may be to hurt them back, A more effective strategy is to neutralize the impact of their behavior, don't hit Zen master back, just take away the stick, simply remove their ability to attack you. Difficult customer who makes an unreasonable demand, if you say no, the customer gets angry and goes over your head to your boss. Speak to your boss in advance and explain, and ask your boss to refer the customer politely back to you. And give your customer your boss number.
11. Never take a person's dignity, it is worth everything to them and nothing to you. People could be a jerk or criminals, but for your own sake, safety, and interest, at least respect them as a human(hostage negotiators).
12. How to respect? Listen to understand, not to refute. Ask clarifying questions, acknowledge the other's point of view, let them know you value them, and surprise them with recognition.
13. Stick to the facts, Avoid words: should, always, everything. When situation X happens, I feel Y.., Because I want or need Z.
