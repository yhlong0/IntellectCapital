3. Parents work hard--often financially stretching themselves--to buy houses and live in top-performing school districts. Project-based learning feels to many teachers, principals, and parents like a risk. So they teach the familiar way. The purpose of standardized tests is to show how students perform and how prepared they are, and yet these tests get in the way of the best way to prepare them. Even more ironic is the fact that PBL kids do well on standardized tests.
4. Teachers and principals account for their school rankings. If they use the textbooks, materials, and normal way of teaching and yet don't meet their targeted scores, they can reasonably say, "Hey, I did my best with what you gave me." But if they go out on a limb, if they choose a different approach, the finger points just to them.
5. Failing is only productive when two things are true: First, the person who fails actually learns something from it, and second, the failure doesn't permanently close future doors, thus motivating one to try again.
6. Group work goes wrong in two primary ways. First, most often the task assigned isn't actually worthy of group work. What groups do well is solve complex problems that benefit from different experiences, expertise, skills, and knowledge. Groups aren't better at completing tasks that are rote or linear, with a single right answer. The second way group works goes wrong is when the task is sufficiently complex, but no adult is teaching and supporting the skills required to work collaboratively.
7. It's easy to make a list of chores we expected the child to do and the way we expected them to be done, but what would the child really be learning? Was our ultimate goal to teach him how to make a bed perfectly, or was it something deeper--teaching him how to navigate living in a shared space with others? And if the latter, why would I focus on a well-made bed?
