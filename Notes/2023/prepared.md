3. Parents work hard--often financially stretching themselves--to buy houses and live in top-performing school districts. Project-based learning feels to many teachers, principals, and parents like a risk. So they tech the familiar way. The purpose of standardized test is to show how students perform and how prepared they are, and yet these tests get in the way of the best way to prepare them. Even more ironic is the fact that PBL kids do well on standardized tests.
4. Teachers and principals account for their school rankings. If they use the textbooks, materials, and normal way of teaching and yet don't meet their targeted scores, they can reasonably say, "Hey, I did my best with what you gave me." But if they go out on a limb, if they choose a different approach, the finger points just to them.
