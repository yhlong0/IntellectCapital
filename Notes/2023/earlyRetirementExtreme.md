# Early Retirement Extreme

1. Too weak to open a lid? Go buy a tool rather than exercise to become stronger. Want to barbecue, but don't have a grill? Go buy one instead of making a fire pit. Perhaps the best advice to overcoming this consumerist tendency to buy is to study alternative sources of information.
