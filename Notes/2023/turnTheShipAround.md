# Turn the Ship Around

1. Leadership is the enabling art. It is the art of releasing human talent and potential. You may be able to "buy" a person's back with a paycheck, position, power, or fear, but a human being's genius, passion, loyalty, and tenacious creativity are volunteered only. The world's greatest problems will be solved by passionate, unleashed "volunteers".
2. When you as a leader and see teammates doing something wrong, you will have the desire to correct it and even do it for them. You might think you are brilliant, if the team couldn't execute it by themselves, it didn't matter how smart you are.
3. A good leader is even after he left, his unit still performed well, his people still got promoted after 2-4 years. The good leader should build something for the long run, enlightened sense of duty. 
4. Leader make sure we do the right things and manager make sure we do things right(Technical expertise).  
5. If leader unfamiliar with the sub's technical details, he/she couldn't get involved with the specifics of the gear, rely on the crew more, focus on the people and their interactions. 
6. For new leader, ask below questions:
    - What are the things you are hoping I don't change?
    - What are the things you secretly hope I do change?
    - What are the good things about the team we should build on?
    - If you were me what would you do first?
    - Why isn't the team doing better?
    - What are your personal goals?
    - What impediments do you have to doing your job?
    - What will be our biggest challenge to getting Production ready, or deploy code to production
    - What are your biggest frustrations about how team is currently run?
    - What is the best thing I can do for you?
7. You are destined to fail, no matter how good you get at avoiding mistakes, you will always have errors on something as complex as a submarine. You might reduce the number and severity, but there will never be zero. Focusing on avoiding mistakes takes our focus away from becoming truly exceptional. 
8. Information is channeled up the chain of command to decision makers, instead push it down to where the information lived. Don't move information to authority, move authority to the information. 
9. Change your own thinking and hope this leads to new behavior, or change your behavior and hope this lead to new thinking.
10. A little rudder far from the rocks is a lot better than a lot of rudder close to the rocks.
11. Start saying, "Captain, I intend to ..."
12. Instead of manage everything more carefully, check team more frequently, more early. The leader should divest the control and has team be aligned with the goal of the organization.
