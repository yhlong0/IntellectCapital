# Turn the Ship Around

1. Leadership is the enabling art. It is the art of releasing human talent and potential. You may be able to "buy" a person's back with a paycheck, position, power, or fear, but a human being's genius, passion, loyalty, and tenacious creativity are volunteered only. The world's greatest problems will be solved by passionate, unleashed "volunteers".
2. When you as a leader and see teammates doing something wrong, you will have the desire to correct it and even do it for them. You might think you are brilliant, if the team couldn't execute it by themselves, it didn't matter how smart you are.
3. A good leader is even after he left, his unit still performed well, his people still got promoted after 2-4 years. The good leader should build something for the long run, enlightened sense of duty.
