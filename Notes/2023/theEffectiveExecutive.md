# The Effective Executive

1. If you want the average performance of those around you to go up, you must first improve your own performance.
2. Prepare better meetings: Why are we having this meeting?(Purpose), don't raise another matter for discussion and disciplined follow-up.
3. Without an action plan, the executive becomes a prisoner of events. Without check-ins to reexamine the plan as events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events really matter and which are only noise.
4. Meeting Actions:
    - the name of the person accountable for carrying it out
    - the deadline
    - the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand
    - sent a copy of the memo to everyone who'd been present at the meeting.
5. Any given meeting is either productive or a total waste of time.
6. Executives have their own weaknesses, in many areas they are simply incompetent. In these areas, smart executives don't make decisions or take action. They delegate. Decisions are made at every level of the organization, not only by senior executives.
7. Focus on opportunities rather than problems. Problems have to be taken care of, but problem-solving does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.
8. During the war, if these men don't know what to do when they run into an enemy in the jungle, I'm too far away to tell them. My job is to make sure they know. What they do depends on the situation which only they can judge. The responsibility is always mine, but the decision lies with whoever is on the spot.
9. The executive's time tends to belong to everybody else.
