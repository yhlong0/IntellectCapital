# Breaking Through

1. Although my father is a butcher without much formal education, he can multiply two-digit numbers in his head. This is a lesson for me that intelligence and education are not the same thing. A person may lack prestige or a diploma but nevertheless have a swift mind.
2. I couldn't tell you the exact place where work ends and play begins, the boundaries between these things are hazy and indistinct. The most important is work and play can bleed into each other, and become one and the same.
3. By focusing on the things we can control, instead of the things we can't. We can't control anyone's reactions but our own. We shouldn't work to please others or to gain their approval, we must set our own goals and work to satisfy those. When faced with setbacks or failures, we mustn't blame others; assigning blame keeps us focused on things over which we have no power. We can respond to misfortune by learning more, working harder, and being more creative.
4. A lot of things you have to do anyway, why not get something from it? Have a bit of fun, learning something new.
5. Sometimes those with the least share the most.
6. When she joins the new work, her supervisor is not there, she doesn't know the solution, she doesn't know how to make that solution, and she doesn't have ingredients. But you find an excuse only if you don't want to accomplish something. If you genuinely want to do it, you find a way.
