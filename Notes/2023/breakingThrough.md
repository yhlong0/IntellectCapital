# Breaking Through

1. Although my father is a butcher without much formal education, he can multiply two-digit numbers in his head. This is a lesson for me that intelligence and education are not the same thing. A person may lack prestige or a diploma but nevertheless have a swift mind.
2. I couldn't tell you the exact place where work ends and play begins, the boundaries between these things are hazy and indistinct. The most important is work and play can bleed into each other, and become one and the same.
3. By focusing on the things we can control, instead of the things we can't. We can't control anyone's reactions but our own. We shouldn't work to please others or to gain their approval, we must set our own goals and work to satisfy those. When faced with setbacks or failures, we mustn't blame others; assigning blame keeps us focused on things over which we have no power. We can respond to misfortune by learning more, working harder, and being more creative.
4. A lot of things you have to do anyway, why not get something from it? Have a bit of fun, learning something new.
5. Sometimes those with the least share the most.
6. When she joins the new work, her supervisor is not there, she doesn't know the solution, she doesn't know how to make that solution, and she doesn't have ingredients. But you find an excuse only if you don't want to accomplish something. If you genuinely want to do it, you find a way.
7. Conducting research on RNA presents a series of sophisticated challenges due to its inherently unstable nature and susceptibility to numerous degradative factors. Despite these obstacles, which may dissuade some in the scientific community from engaging with RNA-based studies, it is incumbent upon researchers to devise innovative methodologies and protocols to navigate these complexities. By doing so, scientists reinforce the foundation of molecular biology and expand our understanding of biological mechanisms, thereby advancing the frontiers of biomedical research.
8. Experiments never err, only your expectations do. It might seem that an experiment fails, but that's only because your hypothesis was wrong or because you made an experimental error. Unless you do many different experiments, each time adjusting a little something, you can't possibly know.
9. I recall conversing with a scientist of great repute who had once been at the vanguard of his field but had not kept up with his reading. His lecture seemed like unveiling a time capsule from decades ago, and it was evident that he was stuck in the past. No matter what occurs, I must never stop reading, If I no longer keep up with my reading, I will not give a talk.
10. When I'd first met David, I'd understood that he would be given abundant opportunities. Now I wondered if having lots of options might be its own sort of burden. If many doors are open to you, but you can walk through only a handful in one lifetime, do you live forever haunted by what-ifs?
11. A person isn't a better scientist because she publishes more or first. Perhaps she's holding back from publication because she wants to be absolutely certain of her data. Similarly, the number of citations might have little to do with the value of the paper and more to do with external events. When Drew and I published our landmark Immunity paper, it barely got any notice. It took a pandemic for the world to understand what we'd done and why it mattered.
12. Most institutions define a scientist's value by their funding, most grants require a researcher to define what work they will do, and what discoveries they might make. I'd argue that science is about asking questions, trying things, and going wherever that inquiry takes you. It requires walking into the unknown, the unknown is the very point.
13. If I were to cease working or to diminish my efforts, no one would knock on my door pleading for me to continue. By holding back, I would be surrendering my full potential, and the loss would pass entirely unnoticed: no one would miss the contributions I failed to make. That thought is quite disheartening.
