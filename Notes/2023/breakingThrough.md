# Breaking Through

1. Although my father is a butcher without much formal education, he can multiply two-digit numbers in his head. This is a lesson for me that intelligence and education are not the same thing. A person may lack prestige or a diploma but nevertheless have a swift mind.
2. I couldn't tell you the exact place where work ends and play begins, the boundaries between these things are hazy and indistinct. The most important is work and play can bleed into each other, and become one and the same.
