# Good to Great

1. People are not your most important asset. The right people are.
2. Level 5 leaders: Ambition first and foremost for the company and concern for its success rather than for one's own riches and personal renown.
3. When both steel companies faced the competitive challenge of cheap imported steel. One CEO summed up problems by blaming imports, Another CEO considered the challenge from imports a blessing. Aren't we lucky; steel is heavy, and they have to ship it all the way across the ocean, giving us a huge advantage.
4. When you ask people who work in a successful company, they all point to the Level 5 leader how important he is, however, the Level 5 leader always points right back to the great people and lucky.
5. Get the right people on the bus, the right people in the right seats, and the wrong people off the bus before you figure out where to drive it.
6. The degree of sheer rigor needed in people's decisions in order to take a company from good to great.(execution)
7. It's not how you compensate your executives, it's which executives you have to compensate in the first place. If you have the right executives on the bus, they will do everything within their power to build a great company, not simply because of what they will get for it, but because they cannot imagine settling for anything less. Their moral code requires building excellence for its own sake, and you're no more likely to change that with a compensation package that you're likely to affect whether they breathe.
8. The great companies made a habit of putting their best people on their best opportunities, not their biggest problems.
9. You must retain faith that you will prevail in the end and you must also confront the most brutal facts of your current reality. Life is unfair, sometimes to our advantage, sometimes to our disadvantage. We will experience disappointments and crushing events, what separates people is not the presence or absence of difficulty, but how they deal with the inevitable difficulties of life.
10. Leaders operated with a Socratic style(苏格拉底), they used questions to gain understanding, They didn't use questions as a form manipulation("Don't you agree with me on that?) or as a way to blame others("Why did you mess this up?"). They spent much of the time just trying to understand.
