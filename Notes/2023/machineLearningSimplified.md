# Machine Learning Simplified

1. AI > Machine Learning > Supervised Machine Learning (predict a categorical target variable or a numerical target variable)
2. Supervised Machine Learning: to make predictions about unknown quantities given known quantities, such as predicting a house's sale price based on its location and square footage. Supervised ML does this by learning from, or discovering patterns in, past data. 
3. Classfication problems: try to predict an unknown category, called a class label based on a set of known, or bserved, variables. For instance, any yes-no questions.
    - Yes or no questions, is a new email spam or not.
    - Multiclass, is an unknown fruit an apple, a mandarin or a lemon. 
5. Regression problems: predict an unknown number based on a set of known, or observed, variables. 
    - What would be the unknown price of a house given a set of observed measurements about size, number of rooms, crime rate in the neighbourhood.
    - How many customers will come to our restaurant next Saturday.
