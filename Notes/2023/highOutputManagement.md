# High Output Management

1. Intel was founded on the DRAM business, when Intel gave up its DRAM business because of the attack from the Japanese(cheaper), It started to focus on microprocessor. This adjustment sounds quite logical, in reality, it required moving and re-deploying a lot of employees, letting some of them go, and shutting a number of factories. **They did all this because, under this strong attack, they must lead by their strength. Being second best in a tough global environment is just not good enough.**
2. As a manager, are you adding real value or merely passing information along? How do you add more value?
3. When an individual is not fulfilling their job responsibilities, there are typically two underlying factors at play: either they lack the necessary skills or they lack the motivation. In order to enhance an employee's performance, a manager's primary course of action should be to provide both motivation and training opportunities.
4. As a manager, three things need to be considered: the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, at an acceptable quality level, and at the lowest possible cost.
5. In a perfect world, you don't want the customer to wait, whenever they arrive or whatever time they ask, you should have your product or service ready, but this means you need infinite inventory and a lot of idle resources which is impossible. The best you can do is construct your production flow by starting with the longest(or most difficult, or most sensitive, or most expensive) step and work way back. If boiling eggs takes the most time, focus on that first.
6. For any production operation, you have three components:
     - manufacturing, changing material, writing software, or creating new things.
     - assembly, components put together
     - test, chose in-process test over those that destroy the product. 
7. Whenever possible, you should choose in-process tests over those that destroy the product. Test earlier instead of the last minute on the final product.
8. Build on forecast, based on forecasted demand, developed in response to an anticipated market need, rather than to a specific customer order. It would be foolish to recruit only when a need develops.
9. You will need 3-5 key indicators, you want to know your sales forecast(demand), your current capacity, the difference between your plan and actual delivery, raw material inventory(human resource), condition of your equipment, and quality indicator.
10. Indicators tend to direct your attention, attention creates action. For example, you start measuring your inventory level and drive your inventory levels down. But if inventory is so lean, you can't react to changes in demand and create shortages. To guard against overreacting, you can pair indicators that both effect and counter-effect are measured. For example, monitoring both inventory levels and the incidence of shortages.
11. You measure a salesman by the orders he gets(output), not by the calls he makes(activity)
12. Products are typically developed in response to an anticipated market need rather than to specific customer orders. So 'building' to forecast is a very common business practice. Manufacturers(Developers) need to make one forecast, and sales(Managers) need to make another forecast, trying to match the two as precisely as possible. If there's no match, we either end up with a customer order that we can't satisfy or with a finished product for which we have no customer.
13. To get acceptable quality at the lowest cost, it is vitally important to reject defective material as early as possible. We are better off catching a bad raw egg than a cooked one. POC is a way to reject earlier in software development.
