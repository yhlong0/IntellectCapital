# 100 Bagger

1. Every human problem is an investment opportunity if you can anticipate the solution.
2. To make money in stocks you must have "the vision to see them, the courage to buy them and the patience to hold them." and "patience is the rarest of the three"
3. If you buy a stock that returns about 20 percent annually for 25 years, you'll get your 100-bagger. But if you sell in year 20, you'll get "only" 40 baggers. The last five years will more than double your overall return, so you must wait. You can earn great returns in less than 20 years. But I want to get you to think big.
