# 100 Bagger

1. Every human problem is an investment opportunity if you can anticipate the solution.
2. To make money in stocks you must have "the vision to see them, the courage to buy them and the patience to hold them." and "patience is the rarest of the three"
3. If you buy a stock that returns about 20 percent annually for 25 years, you'll get your 100-bagger. But if you sell in year 20, you'll get "only" 40 baggers. The last five years will more than double your overall return, so you must wait. You can earn great returns in less than 20 years. But I want to get you to think big.
4. For the business, as Darwin said, it is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.
5. Over time the return of a stock and its ROE tend to coincide quite nicely. 
6. Don't buy a company that loses money in a down cycle.
7. Don't buy a company that buybacks and has no sales growth.
8. Don't buy a company that has a high ROE where the top line isn't at least 10 percent.
9. Undervaluation is defined by short-term accounting metrics - low price-to-book, low price-to-cash flow, low price-earnings.
10. Stick with the owner-operators, the founder holds the majority of the stock.
11. High gross margins are the most important single factor of long-run performance. A company started with a high gross profit margin, it tended to keep it. Conversely, when it started off with a low gross profit margin, it tended to stay there as well. For SG & A(selling, general, and administrative = overhead), are volatile, A good turnaround candidate would be a high gross profit margin and high operating cost(a low operating margin). The operating cost is easier to fix than the gross profit margin. The higher the gross margin relative to the competition, the better.
12. Investors tend to like to "buy more lobsters as the price goes up."
13. Best to keep management at a distance, reading conference-call transcripts is better than listening to them. Read several quarters at a time to look for disappearing initiatives, and changes in language. Pay attention, are questions ever evaded? Which ones?
14. A messy, indecipherable disclosures are clues to stay away.
15. When looking at it economic GDP forecast, the consensus always forecasts a middle ground. However, the extremes are where you make(or lose) a lot of money. Consensus forecasts aren't worth much, whether right or not.
16. Over the course of an investing life, stuff is going to happen, both good and bad, that no one saw coming. Instead of playing the guessing game, focus on the opportunities in front of you.
17. In essence, hunting for 100-baggers is completely independent of whatever is happening in the market.
18. General markets tend to come back strongly in periods subsequent to price crashes. That was the case in 1932, 1937, 1962, 1974-75, 1980-82, 1987, 2001-2002, 2007-2008. But here's the hitch, not all stocks are likely to come back.
     1. Overpriced stock
     2. Permanent impairment, a firm goes out of business, a significant loss, or no longer capable of doing what it once was.
     3. Subject to massive dilution during the meltdown, the company issues a bunch of new shares to raise money to cover losses or pay back debt. It's like adding water to your beer and sharing it.
