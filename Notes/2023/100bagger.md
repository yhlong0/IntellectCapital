# 100 Bagger

1. Every human problem is an investment opportunity if you can anticipate the solution.
2. To make money in stocks you must have "the vision to see them, the courage to buy them and the patience to hold them." and "patience is the rarest of the three"
3. If you buy a stock that returns about 20 percent annually for 25 years, you'll get your 100-bagger. But if you sell in year 20, you'll get "only" 40 baggers. The last five years will more than double your overall return, so you must wait. You can earn great returns in less than 20 years. But I want to get you to think big.
4. For the business, as Darwin said, it is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.
5. Over time the return of a stock and its ROE tend to coincide quite nicely. 
6. Don't buy a company that loses money in a down cycle.
7. Don't buy a company that buybacks and has no sales growth.
8. Don't buy a company that has a high ROE where the top line isn't at least 10 percent.
9. Undervaluation is defined by short-term accounting metrics - low price-to-book, low price-to-cash flow, low price-earnings.
10. Stick with the owner-operators, founder holds the majority of the stock.
