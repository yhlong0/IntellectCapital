# Secrets of Power Salary Negotiating

1. It takes you 15 minutes to negotiated compensation, even it is $10 a week, if you're with the company for another 5 years, it is $2600 in 15 mins. Negotiating an increase in pay with your boss really is the highest and best use of your time.
2. Resume
    - It's OK to have a long resume, but not boring one.
    - An attention-grabbing headline to make the reader want to read, 
    - Interesting first paragraph that clearly states what the story is about, then grow and expands with details.
    - Your resume should scream, I can solve your problems!
    - Once they have interviewed you, include your picture on everything so they can recall you better, under your email signature.
3. Treat everyone you meet as if they are the most important person you'll meet that day.
4. The next time you're convinced that somone will never change his mind, think of those tugboats nudging that huge oil tanker around. People do change their minds, just because they told you no a minute agoa, an hour ago, or yesterday, doesn't mean they'll say no again if you ask them one more time, a little bit at a time. 
5. But that wouldn't stop you from hiring me and training me, would it?
6. At no time during the interview should you even suggest that money is an issue. Only start to negotiate the amount once you have a firm offer. 
7. All negotiators know, the longer you can keep someone engaged, the more flexible he or she becomes, whatever it takes, don't leave for 30 more minutes. 
8. Your power is in direct relationship to the options that you have versus the options that the other side has. Reduce your employer's options by doing one part of your job so well that you become irreplaceable. 
9. Develop a plan that shows your employer what you're going to do for him or her next year. Tell all the wonderful things you're going to do for him in that new position. Come to the session with details about the goals you set for last year and how you accomplished nearly all of them. 
10. Remember that if the employer suggests a range, you only respond to the high end of the range. Ignore the low end, "Wow, I was expecting much more than 70,000(low end)!"
11. Concentrate on the dollar amount that's being negotiated. Don't think percentages. 
12. Objections are buying signals. Indifference is the opposite of love. In real estate, the serious buyers were the ones who were saying "kitchen not as big as we like, Hate that wall paper." Those were the ones who would buy.
13. Don't offer to split the difference, let other side suggest split and you continue neogitate use the mid as new start point. Well, I guess this is just not going to fly. It seems like such a shame, when we've both spent so much time working on this. It seems like such a shame that it's not going to go together, when we're only $2000 apart. Let's splitting the difference. Oh, you'd come up to the MID, is that what I hear you saying? Mid sounds a lot better. Let me talk to my family and see how they feel about it. I'll tell them you came up to MID, I'll get back to you tomorrow. 
14. let other side suggest split the difference, you put them in a position of compromise. Then you can reluctantly agree to his proposal, making him feel that he won.
15. Don't let other people give you their problems. "We don't have it in the budget." Test the problem for validity right away. "Well, who would have the authority to exceed the budget?", "When does your budget year end?", "September", "So you would have it in the budget on October 1st?"
16. Trade-Off Gambit: Anytime the other side ask you for a concession in the negotiations, you should automatically ask for something in return. "If I did that for you, what would you do for me?" If you get something in return, even if it's not of equal value, you're a negotiator.
17. Don't do equal size concession, total 10,000, $2500 * 4 times. Avoid making the last concession a big one. Don't create a pattern of expectations in the other person's mind. Make first concession just cinch the deal, after that, make any future concessions smaller and smaller. 50 -> 60 -> 65 -> 67.5
18. Timing is more important than the size of the concession, the size can be ridiculously small and still be effective. 
19. Always congratulate the other person when you get through negotiating, no matter how poorly you think he or she did.
