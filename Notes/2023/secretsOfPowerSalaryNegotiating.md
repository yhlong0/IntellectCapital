# Secrets of Power Salary Negotiating

1. It takes you 15 minutes to negotiated compensation, even it is $10 a week, if you're with the company for another 5 years, it is $2600 in 15 mins. Negotiating an increase in pay with your boss really is the highest and best use of your time.
2. Resume
  - It's OK to have a long resume, but not boring one.
  - An attention-grabbing headline to make the reader want to read, 
  - Interesting first paragraph that clearly states what the story is about, then grow and expands with details.
  - Your resume should scream, I can solve your problems!
  - Once they have interviewed you, include your picture on everything so they can recall you better, under your email signature.
3. At no time during the interview should you even suggest that money is an issue. Only start to negotiate the amount once you have a firm offer. 
4. All negotiators know, the longer you can keep someone engaged, the more flexible he or she becomes, whatever it takes, don't leave for 30 more minutes. 
5. Your power is in direct relationship to the options that you have versus the options that the other side has. Reduce your employer's options by doing one part of your job so well that you become irreplaceable.
