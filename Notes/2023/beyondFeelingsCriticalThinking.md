# Beyond Feelings: A Guide to Critical Thinking

1. Your place of birth, upbringing, culture, and background shape your initial reactions to people, issues, or situations. **Treat your first reaction as tentative**. No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until you've taken a closer look.
2. Examine why you reacted the way you did. Did you borrow the reaction from someone (a parent, friend, or celebrity)? What specific experiences conditioned you to respond in this manner?
3. Consider alternative responses you might have had to the person, issue, or situation. Reflect on whether a different reaction might be more fitting than your initial one. Resist the influence of your conditioning.
