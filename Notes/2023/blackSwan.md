# The Black Swan

1. Before the discovery of Australia, people were convinced that all swans were white. It illustrates a severe limitation to our learning from observations or experience and the fragility of our knowledge. One single observation can invalidate a general statement derived from millennia of confirmatory sightings of millions of white swans. All you need is one single black bird.
2. After 9/11, they add bunch of rules to prevent airplane hijack. However if this prevention is suggest before 9/11, no one will appreciate it or reward this kind of acts.
3. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know.
4. Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity. It is a manifestation of the black swan generator, any reduction of the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world.
