# Basic Accounting from the Lemonade Stand

1. Balance sheet = what we have(asset) + who owns it(liability + equity), the purpose of the Balance Sheet is to connect things to people.
2. Income Statement has a beginning and an end. 
3. Sales(Top Line) - Cost of Goods Sold/Cost of Services = Gross Profit 
4. Gross Profit - Expenses = Net Profit(Bottom Line)
5. Retained Earnings are earnings that are history, or from past accounting periods. 
6. In a corporation, a distribution of earnings means the company pays a dividend to the stockholders. Earnings that have not been distributed are retained in the company.
7. What's a good reason for using FIFO? If future cost go up, FIFO looks better on paper, gives me a better bottom line. And this means more taxes!
8. Why use LIFO? The only reason a business would choose LIFO is to save taxes!
9. The cash statement records only the cash that comes in and the cash that goes out.
10. If earnings are negative, this commonly referred to in business as being in the "red".
11. How does a business decide whether to expense or capitalize an item?
    - Time. How long the item lasts. If lasts longer than one year, you capitalize it. If less than a year you would expense it.
    - Cost. If you buy an item too insignificant, you expense it.
12. Depreciation is an **non-cash expense**, and expense reduce earnings. Two ways for depreciation:
    - Straight line depreciation. Value/years = cost per year.
    - Accelerated depreciation. 10 years, 
        - base $20, cost per year $2, 2 * 2 = $4, 20 - 4 = $16. 
        - base $16, cost per year $1.6, 2 * 1.6 = $3.2, 16 - 3.2 = $12.8
13. Earnings are not cash!
14. What runs the business on a daily basis? Do profits? No, cash runs the business on a daily basis!
15. You can run a business for a while without profits, but you can't run a business for one day without cash. 
16. How to value a business?
    - Cash is in the business
    - Accounts Receivables, call the customers up to see if they agree how much they owe
    - Prepaid Insurance Policy, Read the policy to see what values left.
    - Physical assets, go out and look at it.
    - Inventory, is the toughest part to determine when you're buying or selling a business. You need expertise and help. 

17. Profit is also measurable, however it is not real--it's just a theory.
18. How do you increase profits? Increase sales and decrease Cost of Goods/Services and Expenses. 
19. Looking at a single game doesn't tell us much. You need "trend analysis".
