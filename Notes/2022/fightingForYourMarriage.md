# Fighting For Your Marriage

1. When something important is at stake, you need to make a decision together, because decisions support a greater commitment to follow through on what has been decided. So where it matters, decide don't slide.
2. It's more important to be the right person than to find the right person.
3. You need to hold up your end of the relationship even when you think your partner isn't doing his or her share.
  - Do positive things for your partner
  - Let negative or annoying comments bounce off you
  - Be the best person you can, take responsibility.
4. Success in marriage is related not so much to the nature of the differences between two partners as to how the partners handle the differences they have.
5. When escalation are short-circuited, it is usually because one partner decides to cool things down and says something to de-escalate the argument, thus breaking the negative cycle. Soften your tone, put down your shield and acknowledging your partner's point of view are potent tools you can employ to diffuse tension and end escalation.
6. If a negative interpretation is strong enough, nothing the one on the receiving end of it can do will change it. When your mind reading includes negative judgments about the thoughts and motives of the other, you may be heading toward real trouble in your marriage. (Wife think husband don't want to visit her parents, while husband is considering budget)
7. If you raise concerns directly but more gently with your partner, if you pay serious attention to concerns your partner raises, you are far more likely to have a good conversation, respect in action!
8. One powerful way to make talks safe is to have agreed on rules, rules for both of you:
  - The Speaker has the floor, use a real object to designate the floor
  - Share the floor
  - No problem solving
9. Rules for the speaker
  - Speak for yourself, don't mind-read. Talk about your thoughts, feelings and concerns, not your perceptions of the listener's point of view or motives. Try to use "I" statements
  - Don't go on and on
  - Stop and let the listener paraphrase
10. Rules for listener:
  - Paraphrase what you hear
  - Don't rebut, focus on the speaker's message, you may not offer your opinion or thoughts
 
11. You do not have to agree with your partner to be a good listener.
