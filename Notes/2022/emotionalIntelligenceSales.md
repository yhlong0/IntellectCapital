# Emotional Intelligence for Sales Success

1. We are what we repeatedly do
2. When customer question why your price so high? Competitor is half your price. If you don't recognize this hot button, your emotional response can be quickly concede and offer a discount. **Move the conversation from price to value.**
3. Slow down and analyze your business development activities. Figure out whether you are being productive or are just busy.
4. It's important to remember that an interested prospect is just that --interested, not qualified. Is prospect's problem really big enough for him/her to switching vendors or him/her just need to have another conversation with current vendor. 
5. Top salespeople don't live in the land of hope and denial. They test the reality of a potential opportunity to make sure they are running an appointment with prospects , not suspects. (if this prospect is just whining or really ready to make a change)
6. All things being equal, people buy from people they like. All things not being quite equal, people still may buy from people they like.
7. Walk a mile in another person's shoes without ever actually putting them on. 
8. Seeking the truth during sales meetings should be the goal of every salesperson. Ask questions and come to a solution that makes the most sense for the customer, rather than simply try to land a deal and hit your quota. Same thing apply to lawyer, it is not who you charge more, it is seeking the truth and doing the right thing.
9. As a salespeople, you are equal level to prospects, stop making "I'm just checking in" calls, and start making "let me add value to your day" call.
10. When Prospect don't have budget: "Mr. Prospect, most of our clients donâ€™t have a budget. That's not unusual.(Empathy) However, other clients with similar challenges have invested between X and Y in order to eliminate the problem. Is that a range you are comfortable with?"
11. Your prospect always have some type of budget; otherwise, how can they tell you that your prices are too high?
12. The importance of not being attached to the outcome of a negotiation, referring to the power of being willing to walk away.
13. If I had only one dollar left to spend, I'd invest it in training and development for my people. This is a man who believe in lifelong learning.
