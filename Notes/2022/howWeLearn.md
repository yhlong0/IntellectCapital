# How we learn

1. Two systems in the brain to handle memory, conscious and subconscious. We can track and write down what we learned in history class(conscious), but not in soccer practice(subconscious), physical skills accumulate without our having to think much about them. 
2. The harder we have to work to retrieve a memory, the greater the subsequenet spike in retrieval and storage strength(learning) -- desireable difficulty
3. The background music weaves itself subconsciously into the baric of stored memory, when same music play again, it helps retrieve a memory.
4. If you learn same thing at different environmental context, it improved retrieval strength.
