# How we learn

1. Two systems in the brain to handle memory, conscious and subconscious. We can track and write down what we learned in history class(conscious), but not in soccer practice(subconscious), physical skills accumulate without our having to think much about them. 
2. The harder we have to work to retrieve a memory, the greater the subsequenet spike in retrieval and storage strength(learning) -- desireable difficulty
3. The background music weaves itself subconsciously into the baric of stored memory, when same music play again, it helps retrieve a memory.
4. If you learn same thing at different environmental context, it improved retrieval strength.
5. With longer spaces, you're forgetting more, but you find out what your weknesses are and you correct for them. 
6. If you read a piece of text it by heart so easily as if you read it ten times while attempting to recite it from time to time and consulting the next when your memory fails. A curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better by active than by passive repetition.
7. The best results are obtained by introducing recitation after devoting about 30-40% of the time to reading.
8. People remembered 90% more of the interrupted and unfinished assignments than the ones they'd completed and those jobs were at the top of their lists.(蔡加尼效应)
9. Once a goal becomes activated, it trumps all others and begins to drive our perceptions, our thoughts, our attitudes(confirmation bias)
10. Group by topics vs random topics, the first one is a better way for study.
11. The implication is that if you are preparing for a performance--a music recital, say--it's better to stay up late than get up early, these coaches that have athletes or other performers up at five o'clock in the morning, I think that's crazy.
12. A math or chemistry test an exam that's going to strain your ability to detect patterns, better to stay up late and, if possible, hit the snooze button in the morning.
