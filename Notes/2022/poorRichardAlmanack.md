# Poor Richard's Almanack

1. Human felicity(幸福) is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. 
2. A house without woman & firelight, is like a body without soul or sprite
3. Eat to live, not live to eat
4. The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.
5. Do what you ought, and not what you please.
6. Whatever begun in anger ends in shame
7. If you ride a horse, sit close and tight, if you right a man, sit easy and light
8. Beauty and folly are old companions
9. Better slip with foot than tongue.
10. All things are cheap to the saving, dear to the wasteful
11. Would you persuade, speak of interest, not of reason.
12. Teach your child to hold his tongue, he'll learn fast enough to speak
13. As sore places meet most rubs, proud folks meet most affronts(侮辱).
