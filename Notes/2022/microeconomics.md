# Principles of Microeconomics

1. **Economics**, comes from the Greek word oikonomos, which means "one who manages a household", the study of how society manages its scarce resources. 
2. **Efficiency**, the property of society getting the most it can from its scarce resources. The greater the efficiency, the bigger the pie.
3. There is trade-off between efficiency and equality. Government policies could aimed at equalizing the distribution of economic well-being(welfare system, unemployment insurance). This means higher tax for rich and reduces the reward for working hard, reduce the efficiency, the pie get smaller. 
4. Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs. When you pay fix cost $40/month for phone service and $0.5/minute for every phone call, $0.5 is your marginal costs, $5 for 10 minutes call is your marginal benefits. 
5. Governments responsibilities: 
    - enforce property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources
    - when market failure(externality, the impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander), pollution is an example. 
    - stop monoploy, single person or firm to unduly influence market prices.
