# Principles of Microeconomics

1. **Economics**, comes from the Greek word oikonomos, which means "one who manages a household", the study of how society manages its scarce resources. 
2. **Efficiency**, the property of society getting the most it can from its scarce resources. The greater the efficiency, the bigger the pie.
3. There is trade-off between efficiency and equality. Government policies could aimed at equalizing the distribution of economic well-being(welfare system, unemployment insurance). This means higher tax for rich and reduces the reward for working hard, reduce the efficiency, the pie get smaller. 
4. Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs. When you pay fix cost $40/month for phone service and $0.5/minute for every phone call, $0.5 is your marginal costs, $5 for 10 minutes call is your marginal benefits. 
5. Governments responsibilities: 
    - enforce property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources
    - when market failure(externality, the impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander), pollution is an example. 
    - stop monoploy, single person or firm to unduly influence market prices. 
6. Cigarette lighters don't cause cancer(omitted variable), minivans don't cause larger families(reverse causality)
7. Although it is possible for one person to have an absolute advantage in both goods, it is impossible for one person to have a comparative advantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one good is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person's opportunity cost of one good is relatively high, the opportunity cost of the other good must be relatively low. 
      - Sports star can film a TV commercial in 2 hours and earn $30,000 or mow his lawn 2 hours. To lawn his backyard, the opportuity cost($30,000) is pretty high. Forrest Gump can mow his lawn in 4 hours, in that same 4 hours, Forrest could work at McDonald's and earn $50. Forrest has a comparative advantage in mowing lawns. If sports star willing to pay between $50-$30,000 for Forrest mow his lawn, both of them will be better off.  
8. When minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still attending high school choose to drop out and take jobs. 
9. Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the good sold is smaller in the new equilibrium. 
10. Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes and a tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic. A new luxury tax on yachts might cause rich people buy other stuff or golf, take a vacation. However, the yachts factory, middle workers are suffer more of the tax burden. 
11. Deadweight losses(Tax issue), Mike clean Mei's house for $100, Mike opportunity cost $80, Mei's time opportunity cost $120, thus total $40 surplus. When you add $50 tax for cleaning services. There is no price for deal to happen, socity total lost $40 surplus, everyone become worse. Tax prevent buyers and seller from realizing some of the gains from trade. 
12. The Laffer Curve indicate the heavy tax, more deadweight loss and less tax revenue. the little tax, less deadwight loss, little revenue. Somewhere in the middle might be the best.
