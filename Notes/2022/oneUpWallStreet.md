# One Up on Wall Street

1. The stock price is the least useful information you can track, and it's the most widely tracked. If you can only track one thing for the company, look at the company earning. 
2. When market crashed, my uncle said "never get involved in the market, it's too risky, You'll lose all your money". This taught me not only that it's difficult to predict markets, but also that small investors tend to be pessimistic and optimistic at precisely the wrong times. So it's self-defeating to try to invest in good markets and get out of bad ones.
3. Why invest house, you barely lose money?
    - remarkable power of leverage, 5x, compare to stock you only get 2x
    - you won't get margin call when house price goes down
    - you get tax deduction when paying mortgage 
    - house is a perfect hedge against inflation
    - you can have a forty-year run in houses without paying taxes
    - you won't check your house market price every day.
    - you won't sell your house by checking a market price. 
    - average people hold your house 7 years, compare to stock, they change hands every year. 
    - you know how to do the research before buy the house, you check every thing and hire experts.
    - you spend months do the research before buying the house, and mninutes choosing their stocks. 

4. Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the foreseeable future.
5. Whether the Index(Dow Jones/SPY/NASDQA) average was 1000, 2000 or 3000 today, you'd be better off having owned great company.
