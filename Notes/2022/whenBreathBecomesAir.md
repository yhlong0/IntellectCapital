# When Breath Becomes Air

1. A docter almost graduated, go through hard work, diagnoise end stage lung cancer. Doctor career suddenly become not important, decide to have a baby, repair the relationship with wife. Start the treatment, luckily has a drug specific for his type of cancer, recovery, back to docter career try to finish it. Eat pain killer between each OR, at the end cancer back to him and chemo thearpy not working almost kill him and body quickly detierate and end his life. 
2. If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examing?
3. As a resident(docter), my highest ideal was not saving lives--everyone dies eventually--but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness.
4. Severe illness wasn't life-altering, it was life-shattering. 
5.
