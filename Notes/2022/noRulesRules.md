# No Rules Rules

1. **High density of talent**
    - sap manager's energy
    - reduce the team motivation, quality of discussions, lowering team's overall IQ. 
    - low the average intelligen of the team
    - force others to develop ways to work around them, reduce efficiency.
    - show the team you accept the mediocrity
    - drive the stuff who seek execellent quit
2. For top performers, a great workplace isn't about lavish office, a beautiful gym or a free sushi lunch. It's about the joy of being around by people who are both talented and collaborative.
3. Performance--both good and bad--is infectious. 
4. **Introduce candor**
    - only say about someone what you will say to their face. 
    - we hate candor, but we still want it. 
    - 4A principle for positive feedback: aim to assit(explain how a change help individual or company, not you), actionable, appreciate(a belong cue, small gesture, tone of voice, thank for their courage), accept or deny(you and provider must understand that the decision to react to the feedback is entirely up to the recipient)
    - A new device show your car current speed and give warning will help a lot reduce the speed in school zone and etc. Feedback is important.
    - The higher you get in an organization, the less feedback you receive, and the more likely you are to "come to work naked like emperor's new clothes" or make errors that's obvious to everyone but you. 
6. **Remove controls**
    - the value of creative work should not be measured by time. You want to give a promotion not because he/she works like crazy, but because he/she is making a huge impact. 
    - leader model taking big vacations
