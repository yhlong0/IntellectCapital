# No Rules Rules

1. **High density of talent**
    - sap manager's energy
    - reduce the team motivation, quality of discussions, lowering team's overall IQ. 
    - low the average intelligen of the team
    - force others to develop ways to work around them, reduce efficiency.
    - show the team you accept the mediocrity
    - drive the stuff who seek execellent quit
2. For top performers, a great workplace isn't about lavish office, a beautiful gym or a free sushi lunch. It's about the joy of being around by people who are both talented and collaborative.
3. Performance--both good and bad--is infectious. 
4. **Introduce candor**
    - only say about someone what you will say to their face. 
    - we hate candor, but we still want it. 
    - 4A principle for positive feedback: aim to assit(explain how a change help individual or company, not you), actionable, appreciate(a belong cue, small gesture, tone of voice, thank for their courage), accept or deny(you and provider must understand that the decision to react to the feedback is entirely up to the recipient)
    - A new device show your car current speed and give warning will help a lot reduce the speed in school zone and etc. Feedback is important.
    - The higher you get in an organization, the less feedback you receive, and the more likely you are to "come to work naked like emperor's new clothes" or make errors that's obvious to everyone but you. 
6. **Remove controls**
7. Vacation:
    - the value of creative work should not be measured by time. You want to give a promotion not because he/she works like crazy, but because he/she is making a huge impact. 
    - leader model taking big vacations, however, leader needs to set context, understand the important work and arrange their work before vacation, always act in the best interests of the company
    - never do anything that makes it harder for others to achieve their goals
    - do whatever you can to achieve your own goals
8. Giving employees more freedom led them to take more ownership and behave more responsibly, they even started throwing out the milk in the refrigerator when it got sour
9. Travel and expense:
    - When I saw how senior management spends their time(set rules for travel expense), I lost confidence in the company. 
    - Spend company money as if it were your own and act in company's best interest.
    - Before you spend any money imagine that you will be asked to stand up in front of CFO or your own boss and explain why. If you can explain comfortably why that purchase is in the company's best interest, then no need to ask, go ahead and buy it. But if you'd feel a little uncomfortable, skip the purchase, check in with your boss, or buy something cheaper. 
    - lack of process speeds everything up.
    - some employees actually spend less when the expense policy is lifted. 
10. Abuse the freedom and you're out -- plus you'll be used as an example to others for what not to do.
11. Pay top of personal market:
    - Divided jobs into operational and creative roles, creative job can out perform 10-100x.
    - Increase pay to top of the market, not bonus pool, to keep the talents 
    - Employee should know his value better, call recruiter and share the info with boss.
    - Bonus are bad for flexibility, get 200k for sure vs 150k + 50K bonus, people will like the first. Also no KPI associate with bonus, they might achieve more than what you expected.
    - If compensation is based on specific financial performance metrics(increase operating profit 5%), people might not do something lost in short term which increase five years competitive. Wrong incentive conflict with long term goal. 
    - If that talent people is important and you don't have enough money to pay him, get ride of the mediocre one.
12. Open the book 
    - employees are adult, no need umbrella to protect them.
    - it is company's job to treat you like an adult and give you all the info(re-org, financial statement and etc), people can make better decision themselves. If you know you might get lay off, you can better decide whether to buy the house or not. 
    - boss should avoid close office door, lock drawer, he should approach employee and talk to them, instead of asking them come to your office. 
    - after fire someone, be candor, no need to spin or make it looks good. 
    - when you screw up, whisper wins and shout mistakes, sunshining a leader's error is to encourage everyone to think of making mistakes as normal, take risks when success is uncertain, build trust. 
13. The pratfall effect: Awesome person make small mistake increase your appeal, mediocre people's mistake low their appeal. Leader need to build trust in his competency before shouting your mistakes. 
13. No Decision Making Approvals needed
    - Your job is not to please your boss, do something your boss will approve. It's to do what is right/best for the business.
    - share all the context of your decision, done the groundwork.
    - if someone comes to you(leader) with a proposal you think is going to fail, ask yourself if you paid top of the market.he is a stunning employee, has good judgment, make positive impact.
    - Farm for dissent or socialize the idea
    - For a big idea, test it out.
    - As the informed captain, make your bet.
    - If it succeeds, celebrate. If it fails, sunshine it. Ask what you learned, manager need to expresss interest in the takeaways, but no condemnation. don't make a big deal about it.
14. Netflix does not operate in a safety-critical market, like medicine or nuclear power. In some industries, preventing error is essential. We are in a creative market. Our big threat in the long run is not making a mistake, it's lack of innovation.
15. Professional sports team vs family. Best team player, not because you are a family member so we need to be nice with you or take care your stuff. 
16. When fire someone just adequate performance, give a generous severance package. The cost for keeping such people are higher, and give couple months salary avoid sue the company later. They can plan their future better. 
17. Employee ranking system is bad and you must let go of X percent your people will cause people sabotage each other(one employee doesn't have to lose for the other to win). Keeper test(ask your boss, if you were thinking of leaving, how hard he would work to change your mind.) is better and no fixed number of slots. However this will cause fear, suggestion: don't focus on things you fear, focus on learning, teamwork and accomplishment.
