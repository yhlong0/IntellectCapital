2. The evolution should select for larger brains may seem to us like a no-brainer. We are so enamoured of our high intelligence that we assume that when it comes to cerebral power, more must be better. But if that were the case, the feline family would also have produced cats who could do calculus. Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire animal kingdom to have come up with such massive thinking machines? Bigger brain also has cost, energy cost, stand up make back pain.
3. The fire of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teetch and shorter intestines.
4. Gather Hunter eat more health and diversify. Once we enter argiculter, we start eating rice all the time. for gather hunter you eat whatever you get. Also, you don't work that hard, 30hrs a week. 
5. Human able to survive at hottest place to the coldest place, from east to west, to america. No other animal had ever moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly, everywhere using virtually the same genes. 
6. The agricultural revolution is a big fraud to luxury life. When gather hunter, you work less, eat more variety of foods. The pursuit of an safer/easier life resulted in much hardship and it happens to us today as well, college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests. But by the time they reach 30-35, they have large mortgages, children to school, two cars per family and a sense that life is not worthing living without really good wine and expensive holidays aborad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away. 
7. Hammurabi has a of rules, blind the eye/bone of another, they shall blind his eye/bone, superior, commoner, slave, man, woman are all different class and worth different money. American believe we are all equal, both trying to enable us to create a stable and prosperous society. However, all these are 'imagined order'. We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. It is not evil conspiracies or useless mirages, rather they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively. Same thing for myth, god and etc. 
8. It is impossible to organise an army/police/astrounant/doctors(whoever have to risk their life) solely by coercion. At least some of the commanders and soldiers must truly believe in something be it God, honour, motherland, manhood or money. 
9. Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. Open ourselves to a wide spectrum of emotions, relastionships, cuisines, music. Break free from our daily routine, go travelling, where we can 'experience' the culture, the smells, the tastes.
10. Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need to buy a product or a service. Every television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service will make life better. The tourism industry does not sell flight tickets and hotel bedrooms. It sells experiences. 
11. Money is a system of mutual trust, it is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised(Intrinsic value). Easy for transcations and store.
