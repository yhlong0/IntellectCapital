2. The evolution should select for larger brains may seem to us like a no-brainer. We are so enamoured of our high intelligence that we assume that when it comes to cerebral power, more must be better. But if that were the case, the feline family would also have produced cats who could do calculus. Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire animal kingdom to have come up with such massive thinking machines? Bigger brain also has cost, energy cost, stand up make back pain.
3. The fire of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teetch and shorter intestines.
4. Gather Hunter eat more health and diversify. Once we enter argiculter, we start eating rice all the time. for gather hunter you eat whatever you get. Also, you don't work that hard, 30hrs a week. 
5. Human able to survive at hottest place to the coldest place, from east to west, to america. No other animal had ever moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly, everywhere using virtually the same genes. 
6. The agricultural revolution is a big fraud to luxury life. When gather hunter, you work less, eat more variety of foods. The pursuit of an safer/easier life resulted in much hardship and it happens to us today as well, college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests. But by the time they reach 30-35, they have large mortgages, children to school, two cars per family and a sense that life is not worthing living without really good wine and expensive holidays aborad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away. 
7. Hammurabi has a of rules, blind the eye/bone of another, they shall blind his eye/bone, superior, commoner, slave, man, woman are all different class and worth different money. American believe we are all equal, both trying to enable us to create a stable and prosperous society. However, all these are 'imagined order'. We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. It is not evil conspiracies or useless mirages, rather they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively. Same thing for myth, god and etc. 
8. It is impossible to organise an army/police/astrounant/doctors(whoever have to risk their life) solely by coercion. At least some of the commanders and soldiers must truly believe in something be it God, honour, motherland, manhood or money. 
9. Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. Open ourselves to a wide spectrum of emotions, relastionships, cuisines, music. Break free from our daily routine, go travelling, where we can 'experience' the culture, the smells, the tastes.
10. Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need to buy a product or a service. Every television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service will make life better. The tourism industry does not sell flight tickets and hotel bedrooms. It sells experiences. 
11. Money is a system of mutual trust, it is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised(Intrinsic value). Easy for transcations and store.
12. However, there is the price of money, when you have something that can universaliy convert and trust, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand. **Human communities and families have always been based on belief in "priceless" things, such as honour, loyalty, morality and love.** Money has always tried to break through these barriers. The even darker side, although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is not in humans, but in money itself. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour--we trust the coin they hold. If they run out of coins, we run out of trust. 
13. How gold get value, especially for people who never value the gold? Assume one part of people love and value the gold, another don't. If there is merchants travelling between these two places, they will move gold around and make a profit(arbitrage). The value of the gold will decrese in the place people value it and increase the value for place people don't value it. Eventually this is enough to strengthen its own belief in them. Religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something. 
14. Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions(Thanksgiving Turkey). We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.
15. Modern science differs from previous traditions of knowledge(theology) in three critical ways:
    - The willingness to admit ignorance
    - The centrality of observation and mathematics
    - The acquisition of new powers
16. Ancient traditions of knowledge admitted only two kind of ignorance. First, an individual might be ignorant of something important. To obtain the necessary knowledge, all he needed to do was ask somebody wiser. There was no need to discover something that nobody yet knew. Ask the local priest. Second, an entire tradition might be ignorant of unimportant things. Whatever the great gods or the wise people of the past did not bother to tell us was unimportant. If a peasant wanted to know how spiders weave their webs, it was pointless to ask priest, there was no anser to this question in any of the Christian Scriptures. **That did not mean that Christianity was deficient.** Rather it meant that understanding how spiders weave their webs was unimportant. After all, God knew perfectly well how spiders do it. If this were a vital piece of information, necessary for human prosperity and salvation(得救/拯救), God would have included a comprehensive explanation in the Bible.
17. Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal.
