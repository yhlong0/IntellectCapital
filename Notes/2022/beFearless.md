# Be Fearless

1. Challenge yourself by asking the question: "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
2. Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come, get up and make them.
3. Look a mile down the road, you'll say, I'm never going to make it. But you can always make it three more feet. Some days are hard, some days are easy but you just keep going, remind yourself that tomorrow will likely be easier.
