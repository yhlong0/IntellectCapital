# Be Fearless

1. Challenge yourself by asking the question: "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
2. Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come, get up and make them.
3. Look a mile down the road, you'll say, I'm never going to make it. But you can always make it three more feet. Some days are hard, some days are easy but you just keep going, remind yourself that tomorrow will likely be easier.
4. At 1961, as President Kennedy said, "We choose to go to the moon in this decade." We choose. And we did.
5. It's not about the amount of wealth you can accumulate or the amount of profits you can drive, it's about the impact and change that you can create.
6. You don't wait to find the time for what is important. You make the time for things that matter.
