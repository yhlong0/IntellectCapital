1. Tax Lien Certificates Risks
  - Location not good, next to plant, 
  - Has Env issue.
  - If the assessment/appraised value appears to be unreasonably low for the area, you should not deal with the property until you have explained the discrepancy.
  - The structure issue, salvage value, might need to demolished before you could make any use of the property.
  - Raw land is a much more difficult investment to check out than improved property(half-build,some changes, maybe minor changes to make property or land better use) 
  - land sits atop an old dump or major earthquake fault
  - Zoning a property as open space, can not convert from raw to improved.
  - Flooding
  - Water rights: land with no access to water, particularly in the dry western states.
  - Sewage disposal: developed areas we have sewage disposal for granted, just need to hook up to the sewer line, in many areas, there may not be a sewer line.
  - Beware of phony improvements
  - Be friends with the county clerk, some counties have entire towns where you would not want an interest in preperty.
  - Stick with **Residential Properties** to avoid env issues, phase 1,2 investigation.
  - Need to be alert if you get a notice of **Bankruptcy**, may need to file a claim, checking the Bankruptcy Court files in the owner's district of residence.
  - Avoid property that lender is FDIC(Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), if you plan to foreclose, check who the lender is and if it is FDIC, hold off on foreclosing until a successor has taken over.
  
2. Look for hidden value, you only need to sell your property to one person. 
3. Diversify, you may eventually meet up with a property that is not even worth the small amount of your tax lien.
