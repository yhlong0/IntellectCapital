# Elon Musk

1. The only thing that make sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment.
2. Elon would come home at eleven and work some more. People didn't always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was. 
3. When Musk first son died, he didn't see the value in grieving publicly. "It made me extremely sad to talk about it, I am not sure why I'd want to talk about extremely sad events. It does no good for the future. If you've got other kids and obligations, then wallowing in sadness does no good for anyone around you."
4. He would place urgency that he expected the revenue in ten years to be ten million dollars a day and that every day we were slower to achieve our goals was a day of missiong out on that money.
5. Generally you do want to have a timeline where, based on everything you know about, the schedule should be X, and you execute towards that, but with the understanding that there will be all sorts of things that you don't know about that you will encounter that will push the date beyond that. **It doesn't mean that you shouldn't have tried to aim for that date from the beginning.** In order to achieve the external promised schedule, you've got to have an internal schedule that's more aggressive than that.
6. The car dealers charge more than independent mechanics but give people the peace of mind that their car is being worked on by a specialist for a particular make of vehicle. Tesla makes its profits off the initial sale of the car and then from some optional software services.
