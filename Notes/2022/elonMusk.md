# Elon Musk

1. The only thing that make sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment.
2. Elon would come home at eleven and work some more. People didn't always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was. 
3. When Musk first son died, he didn't see the value in grieving publicly. "It made me extremely sad to talk about it, I am not sure why I'd want to talk about extremely sad events. It does no good for the future. If you've got other kids and obligations, then wallowing in sadness does no good for anyone around you."
