# Educated

A story for experiences and change.

1. All the decisions that go into making a life--the choices people make, together and on their own, that combine to produce any single event.
2. People want a miracle, they'll swallow anything if it brings them hope, if it lets them believe they're getting better. But there's no such thing as magic. Nutrition, exercise and a careful study of herbal properties, that's all there is . But when they're suffering, people can't accept that. 
3. When someone is busy, go ask him if he need a help, then you will have a job. 
4. Religon / no education will casue a lot of false belief and you might face bunch of troubles in your life, you might feel hopeless, but there is answer for a lot of your pain.
