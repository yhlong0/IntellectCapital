A story for experiences and change.

1. All the decisions that go into making a life--the choices people make, together and on their own, that combine to produce any single event.
2. People want a miracle, they'll swallow anything if it brings them hope, if it lets them believe they're getting better. But there's no such thing as magic. Nutrition, exercise and a careful study of herbal properties, that's all there is . But when they're suffering, people can't accept that.

She's just standing, Professors are all trying to compensate, to get their bodies lower because the height scares you. But the crouching and the sidestepping are not natural. You've made yourselves vulnerable. If you could just control your panic, this wind would be nothing.
