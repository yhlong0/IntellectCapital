# Principles

1. It isn't easy to be confident that your opinions are right. In the markets, you can do a huge amount of work and still be wrong.
2. Bad opinions can be very costly. Most people come up with opinions and there's no cost to them. Not so in the market.
3. The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make anymoney, you have to be right when everyone eles is wrong.
4. Each group there are differences and they are intended to paint a picture of the world the way they'd like it to be rather than the way it really is.
5. The desire to evolve, to get better is humanity's most pervasive driving force. Enjoy your job, a craft, sport comes from the innate satisfaction of getting better, it is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us. Our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals rather than by striving for them. 
6. Many people made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their primary goal. Instead, they simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it. There are many people who really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they didn't make a lot of money. Making money really is what you can give to other people
7. The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decision we make. We aren't born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it. You can play phone or read a book, eat health, workout or lay bed and eat junk food.
8. Pain + reflection = progress
9. Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes they are barriers that stand in our way of getting what we want. Eat sugar, first feel good, but bad for our health.
10. By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn't give a damn what you "like". So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things--which often are difficult but produce good results--so that you'll then deserve to get what you want.
11. Never say anything about a person you wouldn't say to them directly, and don't try people without accusing them to their face, don't let loyalty stand in the way of truth and openness. 
12. When you experience pain, clam yourself down and think about what is causing your psychological pain. 
13. Don't have anything to do with closed-minded, inexperienced people. They won't do you any good and there's no helping them until they open their minds, so they will waste your time in the meantime. If you must deal with them, the first thing you have to do is open their minds, this require some technic and good guidance.
14. If you're less than excited to hire someone for a particular job, don't do it. The two of you will probably make each other miserable.
15. An authoritarian approach means you aren't developing your employees, and over time they will become increasingly dependent on you.
16. When criticizing, try to make helpful suggestions. Your goal is to help your people understand and improve, not to hurt them. 
17. Most things are done or not done because someone decided to do them or not do them a certain way, most root causes can be traced to specific people, especially the responsible party. You have to ask why the person made the mistake to get the root cause, and need to accurate in diagnosing a fault.
