# Principles

1. It isn't easy to be confident that your opinions are right. In the markets, you can do a huge amount of work and still be wrong.
2. Bad opinions can be very costly. Most people come up with opinions and there's no cost to them. Not so in the market.
3. The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make anymoney, you have to be right when everyone eles is wrong.
