# Way Of The Wolf

1. Five core elements of the straight line system
  - The prospect must love your product
  - The prospect must trust and connect with you
  - The prospect must trust and connect with your company
  - Lower the action threshold
  - Raise the pain threshold

2. emotional certainty has to do with painting your prospect a picture of the future where they've bought your product and can see themselves using the product and feeling good as a result of it. We call this technique future pacing
3. It's not the job of sales people to turn nos into yeses; it's simply not what they do. Instead, we turn "Let me think about it" into a yes, and "Let me call you back" into a yes, and "I need to speak to my wife" into a yes, and "It's a bad time of year" into a yes.

4. When you're actually off the straight line, you're developing immediate, massive rapport(融洽关系), on both a conscious and unconsicous level, and second you're gathering massive intelligence, refer to as qualifying
5. Identifying customer needs, not just core need but also secondary needs or problems they might have
6. Identifying core beliefs, such as not feeling comfortable working over the phone or making quick decision, not trusting sales people in general.
7. Find out about any past experiences they had with similar products, both good and bad, how they feel about the sales people they bought them from.
8. Identifying their values, meaning, what things are most important to them,
9. Identifying their financial standards, level of wealth and spending ability.
10. Where their pain lies, what's keeping them up at night?
11. Looping: take each individual objection and use it as an opportunity to further increase a prospect's level of certainty without breaking rapport and seamlessly transition into a close.
12. First 4 seconds, make you're a person worth listening to: 
  - Sharp as a tack, get to the point quickly, not wast the prospect's time
  - Enthusiastic as hell
  - An expert in your field, learn everything about your industry, products, have a solution to their problem, 
  - Be an asset to them over the long-term

13. We all want to deal with pros or experts who are sharp and on the ball, who are enthusiastic about what they do.
14. Instead of saying, "Hi, my name is xxx, from xx company, I'm looking for xxx, is he home?", the salesperson should simply say, "Hi, is John there?" More like a friend you know for a long time.
15. Avoid declarative statement like above example. 
16. If you don't make eye contact at least 72 percent of the time, people won't trust you. 
17. Always ask for permission to ask questions:
  - John, just a couple of quick questions, so I don't waste your time.
  - John, let me just ask you a couple of quick questions, so I can best serve you
  - John, let me just ask you a couple of quick questions, so I can see exactly what you needs are.
20. If client start talking about duck hunting(Pluto), say: Wow, that's totally cool. It sounds really interesting. I can see why you feel that way. Now as far as your goal for learning how to trade currencies goes. ..., lead him back to straight line and pick up right where you left off.
21. When creating certainty, product first, you second, third company, build airtight logical cases first and emotional cases second.
22. When closing, you need to make it as simple/easy as possible. Money is stored energy, when you ask prospect to expend so much energy they hard made, you want to offset that money spending by highlight all benefits they going to receive in return.
23. Intelligence-gathering, what do you like or dislike about your current supplier? What is your biggest headache with your business?
