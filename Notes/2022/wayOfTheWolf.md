  - The prospect must love your product
  - The prospect must trust and connect with you
  - The prospect must trust and connect with your company
  - Lower the action threshold
  - Raise the pain threshold

2. emotional certainty has to do with painting your prospect a picture of the future where they've bought your product and can see themselves using the product and feeling good as a result of it. We call this technique future pacing
3. It's not the job of sales people to turn nos into yeses; it's simply not what they do. Instead, we turn "Let me think about it" into a yes, and "Let me call you back" into a yes, and "I need to speak to my wife" into a yes, and "It's a bad time of year" into a yes.
