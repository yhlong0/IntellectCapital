# Financial Statements

1. Watch where the money flows, watch where goods and services flow. Documenting these movements of cash and product is all that financial statements do.
2. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped.
3. Accounts receivable are owed to the enterprise from customers who were shipped goods but have not yet paid for them.
4. Working capital = current assets - current liabilities. Amount of money the enterprise has to "work with" in the short term. Also called net current assets/funds
5. Income statement shows income, then retained earnings are increased on the balance sheet, then either assets increase or liabilities decrease to remain in balance.
6. Receiving cash from customers decreases the accounts receivable on balance sheet. 
7. Par value is the dollar amount that is assigned to shares by the company, Par value has little significance other than to keep track of stock splits.
8. Inventory: Raw Material + Work In Process + Finished Goods
9. All manufacturing costs go into inventory. 
10. A customer's cash payment for goods in no way changes the Income Statement.

12. No taxes -> no earnings -> no dividends
13. **Common Size Income Statements**: All items are presented as a percentage of sales.
14. **Common Size Balance Sheet**: All items are presented as a percentage of total assets.
15. Cash available relative to the level of payables is a good indicator of how easily the company will be able to pay its bills in the future. 
16. **Quick ratio**: quick assets(cash and account receivable) / current liabilities. Inventories are left out. This is a more conservative measure of liquidity.
17. Inventory Turn = cost of goods sold / inventory
18. Asset Turn Ratio = Annual Sales / Assets
19. Receivable Days = Recivables * 365 / Annual Sales
