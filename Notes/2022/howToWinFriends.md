# How to Win Friends

1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain, talk about others interests; if you're wrong admit it; let others save face. They remind you to consider others needs before you speak. 
2. President Lincoln was long known as a man who approached tense situations with poise(镇定) and grace（优雅）
3. The moment you criticize, the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend. And when another is defensive, there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised. Everything you say is then filtered through skepticism, or worse, complete incredulity. In this way critical comments act like invisible boomerangs. They return on the thrower's head.
4. Don't criticize, condemn, or complan, we live in an age where the world can hear our words, where global accountability is a very real possibility, where our communication catastrophes can follow us indefinitely. It is neither wise nor necessary to criticize otheres to make your messages more effective, more important or more newsworthy.
5. There is nothing wrong with informing your fiends about things they might want to avoid, but the spirit of your information is key. Shift your use of media from a spirit of expose and objection to a spirit of encouragement and exhortation.
6. Clam yourself before communicatiing to another. When you are put off, the first five munites are usually the most volatile. If you can train yourself to stuff the knee-jerk response, you will save yourself hours of backpedaling, back-scratching, and brownnosing(拍马屁) down the road. 
7. For in the way you judge, you will be judged and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.
8. We all have an innate, unquenchable dire to know we are valued, to know we matter. Yet affirming this in each other is among the most challenging things to do in our day and age. 
9. If you aim to influence people to change, repeatedly pointing out his rap sheet will do you little good. If instead you begin to remind him of what he could be, with his own history of goodness, of success of insight, even if only a brief history--something inside him would have cause to awaken. 
10. Housemaid knew that one of the calf's core desires was food. Once she tapped into that desire(use a finger as nip), the calf willingly followed. Emerson and his son merely thought about what they desired.
11. Asking thoughtful questions of every new person he met which he didn't know very well.
12. Rule of thumb is to make sure the linear thread of the message trends upward. Always begin and end the message on a positive note rather than on a pessimistic or detached one.
13. Listen longer.
14. What's true in justice holds true in human relationships. There are no neutral exchanges. You leave someone either a little better or a little worse. 
15. Arguing with another person will rarely get you anywhere; they usually end with eachperson more firmly convinced of his rightness. You may be right, dead right, but arguing is just as futile(无效的) as if you were dead wrong.
16. Negotiations become more productive when each party acknowledges that the other may have legitimate concerns.
17. Telling people they are wrong will only earn you enemies. Few people respond logically when they are told they are wrong; most respond emotionally and defensively because you are questioning their judgment. You shouldn't just avoid the words "You're wrong." You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation(语调), or a gesture, so you must guard against showing judgment in all of the ways that you communicate. 
18. Getting to yes is so much easier if you start with yes
19. The worst quality in a leader is taking credit when things go well and dishing out blame when things go wrong. Giving away credit is a magical multiplier
20. If we think others have good motives, not selfish or deceitful, we allow them to increase their own self-worth in their response to use. We allow them to prove us right about them.
21. Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise follow by the word "but", which signals that criticism is about to begin, Use "and" instead. 
22. One time mechanic inject wrong oil and almost kill the pilot, instead of the tongue-lashing, pilot didn't even criticize his gross neligence. He threw his big arm around the mechnic's shoulder and said, "To show you I'm sure that you;ll never do this again, I want you to service my plane tomorrow."
23. We intuitively know that failure is inevitable, so why can't we be more supportive when somebody is suffering through it?
24. Separate the person from the failure, rather than saying "you failed," say "the project failed." In most cases, that is the truth.
