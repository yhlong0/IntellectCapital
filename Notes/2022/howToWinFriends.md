# How to Win Friends

1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain, talk about others interests; if you're wrong admit it; let others save face. They remind you to consider others needs before you speak. 
2. President Lincoln was long known as a man who approached tense situations with poise(镇定) and grace（优雅）
3. The moment you criticize, the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend. And when another is defensive, there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised. Everything you say is then filtered through skepticism, or worse, complete incredulity. In this way critical comments act like invisible boomerangs. They return on the thrower's head.
4. Don't criticize, condemn, or complan, we live in an age where the world can hear our words, where global accountability is a very real possibility, where our communication catastrophes can follow us indefinitely. It is neither wise nor necessary to criticize otheres to make your messages more effective, more important or more newsworthy.
5. There is nothing wrong with informing your fiends about things they might want to avoid, but the spirit of your information is key. Shift your use of media from a spirit of expose and objection to a spirit of encouragement and exhortation.
6. Clam yourself before communicatiing to another. When you are put off, the first five munites are usually the most volatile. If you can train yourself to stuff the knee-jerk response, you will save yourself hours of backpedaling, back-scratching, and brownnosing(拍马屁) down the road. 
7. For in the way you judge, you will be judged and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.
8. We all have an innate, unquenchable dire to know we are valued, to know we matter. Yet affirming this in each other is among the most challenging things to do in our day and age.
