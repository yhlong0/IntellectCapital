# Naked Statistics 

1. It's easy to lie with statistics, but it's hard to tell the truth without them
2. Descriptive statistics exist to simplify, give us a manageable and meaningful summary of the underlying phenomenon, which always implies some loss of nuance or detail and invites abuse. Anyone working with numbers needs to recognize as much.
3. Precision vs accuracy:
    - 3.5416 is more precise than 3.5, however it doesn't mean 3.5416 is a correct number. No amount of precision can make up for inaccuracy. 
    - If you mess up the unit(lbs vs Kg or Dollar vs RMB or M vs Inch), Golf distance measure tool the unit(m/inch), no matter how precise your number are, it is meanless. 
    - Wall street has models so precise to predict market/interest rate and etc, but it doesn't mean their model is correct or falseles, precision can mask inaccuracy by giving us a false sense of certainty.
