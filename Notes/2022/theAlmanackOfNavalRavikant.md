# The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant

1. Wealth is not really about hardwork. You can work in a restaurant eight hours a week, and you're not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can't skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. 
2. Reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.
3. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. 
4. Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It's not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it's not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.
5. You have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it's obsolete four years later. 
6. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you're not going to make the money that gives you financial freedom. You're not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation.
7. You're never going to get rich renting out your time.
8. You need to able to SELL or BUILD. Building the product is hard and it is multivariate. selling has a very broad definition, sell to individual customers, marketing, communicating, recruiting, raising money, inspiring people, doing PR. 
9. I would love to be paid purely for my judgment, not for any work. I want a robot, capital, or computer to do the work, but I want to be paid for my judgment. 
10. We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades. 
11. Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you're worth. 
12. I would argue with my girlfirends, now it's my wife, I don't do that. That's not a problem that I solve. I argue with my mother when she hands me little to-do's. I just don't do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn't have money.
13. How much money you thought were finacially safe? The lust for money is bad. It is not bad in a social sense. It's not bad in the sense of "you're a bad person for lusting for money." It's bad for you. It will always occupy your mind. If you just love money, there's never enough. The best way to stay away from this is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. If you can hold your lifestyle and hopefully make more money, you may get so far ahead you actually become financially free. Use freedom to judge, not a number of money. freedom from things I don't want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. To the extent money buys freedom.
14. Ways to get lucky:
    - Hope luck finds you.
    - Hustle until you sumble into it.
    - Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances other miss.
    - Become the best at what you do. Opportunity will seek you out.
15. You have to do hard things to create your own meaning in life. Making money is a fine thing to choose, go struggle. **Money buys you freedom in the material world, it's not going to make you happy**, it's not going to solve your health problem, it's not going to make your family great, or make you fit, clam. But **it will solve a lot of external problems**. So get yourself rich first, then you want to be peaceful inside, like a monk, give up everything, go out in the woods by yourself to be free inside. 
16. You should never, ever fool anybody, and you are the easiest person to fool.
17. Praise specifically, criticize generally.
