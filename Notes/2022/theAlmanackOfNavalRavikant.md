# The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant

1. Wealth is not really about hardwork. You can work in a restaurant eight hours a week, and you're not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can't skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. 
2. Reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.
3. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. 
4. Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It's not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it's not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.
5. You have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it's obsolete four years later. 
6. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you're not going to make the money that gives you financial freedom. You're not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation.
7. You're never going to get rich renting out your time.
8. You need to able to SELL or BUILD. Building the product is hard and it is multivariate. selling has a very broad definition, sell to individual customers, marketing, communicating, recruiting, raising money, inspiring people, doing PR. 
9. I would love to be paid purely for my judgment, not for any work. I want a robot, capital, or computer to do the work, but I want to be paid for my judgment. 
10. We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades. 
11. Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you're worth. 
12. I would argue with my girlfirends, now it's my wife, I don't do that. That's not a problem that I solve. I argue with my mother when she hands me little to-do's. I just don't do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn't have money.
13. How much money you thought were finacially safe? The lust for money is bad. It is not bad in a social sense. It's not bad in the sense of "you're a bad person for lusting for money." It's bad for you. It will always occupy your mind. If you just love money, there's never enough. The best way to stay away from this is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. If you can hold your lifestyle and hopefully make more money, you may get so far ahead you actually become financially free. Use freedom to judge, not a number of money. freedom from things I don't want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. To the extent money buys freedom.
14. Ways to get lucky:
    - Hope luck finds you.
    - Hustle until you sumble into it.
    - Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances other miss.
    - Become the best at what you do. Opportunity will seek you out.
15. You have to do hard things to create your own meaning in life. Making money is a fine thing to choose, go struggle. **Money buys you freedom in the material world, it's not going to make you happy**, it's not going to solve your health problem, it's not going to make your family great, or make you fit, clam. But **it will solve a lot of external problems**. So get yourself rich first, then you want to be peaceful inside, like a monk, give up everything, go out in the woods by yourself to be free inside. 
16. You should never, ever fool anybody, and you are the easiest person to fool.
17. Praise specifically, criticize generally.
18. Should I marry this person, take this job, buy this house, move to this city... If you cannot decide, the answer is no. And the reason is modern society is full of options. We live on a planet of seven billion people and we are connected to everybody on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of careers available to you. 
19. If you have two choices to make, and they're relatively equal choices, take the path more difficult and more painful in the short term.
20. Read what you love until you love to read. I don't want to read everything. I just want to read the 100 great books over and over again. Reading a book isn't a race--the better the book, the more slowly it should be absorbed. 
21. There are a lot of junk books out there, if you read bad one at early stage, they become your foundation and the new correct thing would be hard to accept by you. To have the best foundation, you want to read hard science, basic math and etc. In those areas, there is no ambiguous.
22. The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse. 
23. It's about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past. The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. 
24. The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. To a tree, there is no concept of right or wrong, good or bad. You're born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations(lights, colors, and sounds), and then you die. How you choose to interpret them is up to you--you have that choice. 
25. Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You're just barely here. You have to make the most of every minute, which doesn't mean you chase some stupid desire for your entire life. What it means is every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it's your responsibility to make sure you're happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way. 
26. Happiness, love, and passion aren't things you find--they're choices you make and a skill you develop. 
27. Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. It's way more important to perfect your desires than to try to do something you don't 100 percent desire. When you're young, you have time, health, but you have no money. When you're middle-age, you have money, health, but no time. When you're old you have money and time, but no health. So the trifecta is trying to get all three at once. By the time people realize they have enough money, they've lost their time and health. 
28. Success doesn't earn happiness, happiness is being satisfied with what you have. 
29. You have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one. 
30. We are social creatures, we're externally programmed and driven. We don't know how to play and win these single-player games anymore. The reality is life is a single-player game. You're born alone. You're going to die alone. All of your interpretations, memories are alone. After three generations, you gone and nobody cares. 
31. You have to go through your life replacing your thoughtless bad habits with good ones, making a commitment to be a happier person. At the end of the day, you are a combination of your habits and the people who you spend the most time with. 
32. If I catch myself judging somebody(he is lazy, he is stupid), I can stop myself and say, What's the positive interpretation of this? I used to get annoyed about things. Now I always look for the positive side of it. It used to take a rational effort. It used to take a few seconds for me to come up with a positive. Now I can do it sub-second. 
33. You always have three choices: You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. To change, it is a desire and cause you suffering until you successfully change it. So don't pick too many desires, just only pick one you want most. The one you should use most is "accept", few hacks to help "accept" things:
     - look at previous suffering and how you get through it.
     - When something annoyance, negative mind happen, what is the positive of this situation, you might be late for meeting, but you have chance to watch and enjoy the birds on the road.
     - Tell yourself the universe is going to teach me something now, I get to listen and learn. 
     - We all gonna die one day, once you embracing death, there is nothing you can't accept. 
34. Life is a firefly blink in a night, there is no legacy, our children, works, civiliztion, solar system will be dust. You got chance to play a life game, so enjoy this fun game and interpret it in the most positive way. If you're not happy, you're not doing anyone any favors, you're wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. 
35. Number one priority in life is your own physical and mental health. Because it is number one priority, you can never say you don't have time. In the morning, work out, and however long it takes is how long it takes. You do not start your day until you worked out. You don't care if the world is imploding and melting down, it can wait another thirty minutes until you are done working out. 
36. Most of our suffering comes from avoidance, Tip-toeing your way in a cold shower suffer most. Once you're in, it's not suffering, it's just cold. Your body saying it's cold is different than your mind saying it's cold. Acknowledge it, accept it, but don't mentally suffer over it. Taking a cold shower for two minutes isn't going to kill you. 
37. Try don't make any judgment, just accept everything for 10-15 minutes every day. You will end up in a very peaceful, grateful state.
38. Impatience with actions, patience with results
39. If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that's their problem. If they have an agreement with you, it's your problem. Other people are going to have lots of expectations out of life. The sooner you candash their expectations, the better. 
40. Courage isn't charging into a machine gun nest. Courage is not caring what other people think. 
41. I don't believe in any short-term thinking or doing business with somebody think in a short-term manner. All benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money, relationships, love, health or habits. Only be around people you know you will to be around for the rest of your life. Only work on things you know have long-term payout. 
42. Anger is a hot coal you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at somebody.
