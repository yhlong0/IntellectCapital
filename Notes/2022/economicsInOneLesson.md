# Economics in One Lesson

1. Broken window will cause baker extra money, so he has less money to do things he wants. People had forgotten the potential third party involved, they see only what is immediately visible to the eye. 
2. No man would want to have his own property destroyed either in war or in peace. What is harmful or disastrous to an individual must be equally harmful or disastrous to the collection of individuals that make up a nation.
3. Government won't operated by the same strict standards as private lender, government lenders will take risks with the taxpayers' money that private lenders will not take with their own money. 
4. Credit is something a man already has. He has it, prehaps, because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned it. He brings it into the bank with him. That is why the banker makes him the loan. The banker is not giving something for nothing. 
5. Machine create more profit and lead to more consumption and investment, three ways to use it:
  - expand current operations, buying more machines, make more products
  - invest the extra profits in some other industry
  - spend extra profits on his own consumption.
6. Machine also free people's time and they can do something more meaningful. Machine and competition draw down the price and eventually consumer gain the benefits.
7. We cannot continuously have the fullest production without full employment. But we can very easily have full employment without full production. We should focus on full production, not full employment.
8. It is exports that pay for imports and vice versa. The greater exports China has, the greater imports China must has, if China ever expect to get paid. U.S. is reverse, greater import, but less export. They probably not plan to pay. 
9. Government should help produce more, set standard, quality of the product, direct resources into the place it needed. Not control the price, because what behind the price is more important. 
10. In an exchange economy everybody's money income is somebody else's cost. Every increase in hourly wages, unless or until compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an increase in costs of production.
11. Inflation is to change the relationships of prices and costs, it may indeed bring benefits for a short time to favored groups, but only at the expense of others. It is designed to raise commodity prices in relation to wage rates and so to restore business profits and encourage a resumption of output at the points where idle resources exist, however this could be brought about more directly and honestly by a reduction in unworkable wage rates.
12. Inflation itself is a form of taxation. It is perhaps the worst possible form, which usually bears hardest on those least able to pay. Cheap-money policies eventually bring about far more violent oscillations in business than those they are designed to remedy or prevent. 
13. The effect of keeping interest rates artificially low is eventually the same as that keeping any other price below the natural market. It increases demands and reduces supply. It increases the demand for capital and reduces the supply of real capital. It creates economic distortions.
14. Saving in short is only another form of spending. The usual difference is that the money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to increase production. 
15. The only thing that will cause people holding cash or cause banks hold funds idle is either fear that prices of goods are going to fall or the fear of banks that will be taking too great a risk with their principal. Signs of a depression have already appeared, and have caused the hoarding, rather than that the hoarding has started the depression. 
16. The analysis has tought us a lesson that when we study the effects of various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short run, but on all groups in the long run.
