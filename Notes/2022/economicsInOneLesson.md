# Economics in One Lesson

1. Broken window will cause baker extra money, so he has less money to do things he wants. People had forgotten the potential third party involved, they see only what is immediately visible to the eye. 
2. No man would want to have his own property destroyed either in war or in peace. What is harmful or disastrous to an individual must be equally harmful or disastrous to the collection of individuals that make up a nation.
3. Government won't operated by the same strict standards as private lender, government lenders will take risks with the taxpayers' money that private lenders will not take with their own money. 
4. Credit is something a man already has. He has it, prehaps, because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned it. He brings it into the bank with him. That is why the banker makes him the loan. The banker is not giving something for nothing. 
5. Machine create more profit and lead to more consumption and investment, three ways to use it:
  - expand current operations, buying more machines, make more products
  - invest the extra profits in some other industry
  - spend extra profits on his own consumption.
6. Machine also free people's time and they can do something more meaningful. Machine and competition draw down the price and eventually consumer gain the benefits.
7. We cannot continuously have the fullest production without full employment. But we can very easily have full employment without full production. We should focus on full production, not full employment.
8. It is exports that pay for imports and vice versa. The greater exports China has, the greater imports China must has, if China ever expect to get paid. U.S. is reverse, greater import, but less export. They probably not plan to pay.
