# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

1. The outside-in paradigm is unhappy people who feel victimized and immobilized, unhappy marriages where each spouse wants the other to change.
2. As an interdependent person, I have the opportunity to share myself deeply, meaningfully, with others, and I have acess to the vast resources and potential of other human beings. Interdependence is a choice only independent people can make. Dependent people cannot choose to become interdependent. They don't have the character to do it, they don't own enough of themselves.
3. True independence of character empowers us to act rather than be acted upon. It frees us from our dependence on circumstances and other people and is a worthy, liberating goal.
4. As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, "No one can hurt you without your consent." In the words of Gandhi, "They cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them." It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place. 
5. Three central values in life--the experiential, or that which happens to us; the creative, or that which we bring into existence; and the attitudinal or our response in difficult circumstances such as terminal illness.
