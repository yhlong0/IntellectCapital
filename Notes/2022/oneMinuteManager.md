# One Minute Manager

1. People who feel good about themselves produce good results.
2. Secret One:
  - We set goals and agree on our most important goals, described on one page. 80% of your important results come from 20% of your goals. 20% is key area of responsibility, maybe three to five goals. In the event of a special project comes up, we set special one minute goals. Each goal can be read in about a minute, we encourage to take a moment every now and then to look at what we're doing and see if it matches our goals.
  - Make it clear what the goals are.
  - Show what good behavior looks like
3. When you have a "problem", if you can't tell what you'd like to be happening, you don't have a problem, you just complaning. A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is *actually* happening and what you *desire* to be happening.
4. Secret Two:
  - Help people reach their full potential, catch them doing something approximately right in the beginning. Then you move on toward the desired result.
  - Praise people as soon as possible especially at the very beginning. 
  - Pause to let people feel good.
  - Encourage them to do more of the same
  - Make it clear you have confidence in them and support their success.
5. The best minute I spend is the one I invest in people. Not technology, maintain buildings, increase salary and etc. 
6. Secret Three: When people make a mistake
  - Re-clarify & agree on goals. If goal not clear it is manager's fault.
  - Confirm what happened, be specific
  - Describe the mistake soon, don't wait and hold for a bag of mistakes and then review once a year. People will be negative when that happened.
  - Say how concerned you feel, pause to let people feel their own concern.
  - Tough on the poor performance but not on the person. Tell them they're better than the mistake and you value them.
  - When it's over, it's over. 


7. Goals begin behaviors, consequences influence future behaviors.
