# Outliers

1. Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.
2. The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measureable real-world.
3. The sense of possibility so necessary for success comes not just from inside us or from our parents. It comes from our time: from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us with. For a young would-be lawyer, being born in the early 1930, software programmer being born in 1955, entrepreneur being born in 1835.
4. Herdsman(牧羊人) is off by himself and under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals. So he has to be aggressive, he has to make it clear through his words and deeds that he is not weak. He has to be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to his reputation -- and that's what a "culture of honor" means.
5. The low-power distance people(US person) don't see any hierarchical gap between themselves and the pilots in the air, and to them, mitigated speech(ah, we're running out of fuel, sir) from a pilot doesn't mean the speaker is being appropriately deferential to a superior. It means the pilot doesn't have a problem. 
6. Why Chinese good at math?
  - Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be uttered in less than 1/4 of a second. (1, 4, 7), this helps when remember many digits in your short memory. 
  - The number system in English is highly irregular, not so in China, Japan, and Korea. Eleven is ten-one, Twelve is ten-two. Twenty-four is two-tens-four. Four-year-old Chinese children can count, on average, to forty. American children can count only to fifteen and most don't reach forty until they're five. A year behind. 
  - When work on addition, English-speaking convert words to numbers, then can he/she do the math. Asian child no number translation is necessary, it is transparent.
  - People from south China, Rice paddy, required more working hours(3500+) compare to gather hunter people only work 1000+ hours. So Chinese has a culture of working hard and extra.(If a man works hard, the land will not be lazy) Same thing apply to math, the more time you spend on it, the better you will get.
7. Success is a function of persistence and doggedness(顽强) and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds. 
8. Why Kids from poor family unable to match the kids from wealth family?
  - Initially, the test score only has minor difference(30 points) at 1st grade.
  - During school time, poor family kids can improve about same points as wealth.
  - During summer time, poor kids watch TV, play outside while rich family kids go summer camp, has a lot of books available for them to read and all kinds of activity to keep them busy. At the end, reading skill poor kids learn nothing when school is not in session.
9. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. 
10. We learn more from extreme circumstances than anything else; disasters tell us something about the way we think and behave that we can't learn from ordinary life.
