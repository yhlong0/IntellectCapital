# Outliers

1. Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.
2. The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measureable real-world.
3. The sense of possibility so necessary for success comes not just from inside us or from our parents. It comes from our time: from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us with. For a young would-be lawyer, being born in the early 1930, software programmer being born in 1955, entrepreneur being born in 1835.
4. Herdsman(牧羊人) is off by himself and under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals. So he has to be aggressive, he has to make it clear through his words and deeds that he is not weak. He has to be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to his reputation -- and that's what a "culture of honor" means.
5. The low-power distance people(US person) don't see any hierarchical gap between themselves and the pilots in the air, and to them, mitigated speech(ah, we're running out of fuel, sir) from a pilot doesn't mean the speaker is being appropriately deferential to a superior. It means the pilot doesn't have a problem.
