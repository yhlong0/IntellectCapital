# Crucial Conversations

1. Crucial conversations:
    - opposing opinions
    - strong emotions
    - high stakes

2. Most leaders get it wrong, they think org productivity and performance are simply about policies, processes, structures or system, however it was in employee behavior, the key to real change lies in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process.
3. When people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a group's ability to make better decisions.
4. The first step to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails(trouble) us.
5. When CEO try to save cost and someone ask a hard question in front of many people. What you can say:
       - You know what, we need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. Thank you for taking the risk. I appreciate the trust it shows in me.(Acknowledged)
       - Admitted that we did not know what the project would cost and check the numbers. Explain building the office was a respone to marketing advice to boost the company's image and improve client confidence. **I have not managed this project as tightly as I'm asking you to manage yours.(admitted error)**
6. Before you get angry, keep asking yourself **what do I really want here, how would I behave if I really wanted these result.**
7. Mutual Purpose at risk:
        - Do others believe I care about their goal in this conversation?
        - Do they trust my motives?
8. Address others' concerns that you don't respect them or have a malicious purpose which you don't. Example: the last thing I wanted to do was not value your work.
9. Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose. Example: I think your work has been spectacular. 
10. When you give up saving face, being right, or winning, and focus on what you really want, sincere apology, you will reward with something even more valuable--healthy dialogue and better result.
11. **Contrasting**, someone has taken something wrong and we've intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. 
12. Wife want to stay home, husband want to go movies. Stay home or go movie is the strategy, Ask each other why do you want to stay home or go movie can help exlore the real purpose, that one person want peace quite, another person want away from children. Then you can brainstorm some better solutions.
13. Others don't make you mad, you make you mad, scared, annoyed or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.
14. Once you've created your upset emotions, you can act on them(find a way to master them) or be acted on by them(fall hostage to them).
15. Facts(what we see and hear) -> we tell a story, add meaning to the Facts -> Feel, make a guess of the motivation -> Act on our feeling.
16. Victim Stories: It's not my fault
17. Villain Stories: It's all your fault
18. Helpless Stories: there's nothing else I can do
19. In Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence, in Villain Stories we over emphasize the other person's guilt or stupidity. Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can't do anything to change our situation. 
20. I know this is difficult and ask for permission to explore those areas, and if she/he is willing, we continue. If not, I apologize for upsetting her/him and ask her/him to tell me when she/he is ready to talk about it.
21. Despite your worst suspicions, you shouldn't violate respect. In a similar vein, you shouldn't kill safety with threats and accusations. 
        - share your facts
        - tell your story
        - ask for others' paths
        - talk tentatively
        - encourage testing
22. When people do express an opinion contrary to yours, thank them for their honesty.
23. Devil's Advocate: If you can't get others to disagree, then disagree with yourself. Let people know that all ideas are open to question.
24. Exercise patience, don't nag, don't lose hope and then go to violence. Every time you become aggressive or insulting, you give your spouse additional evidence that crucial conversations do nothing but cause harm.
