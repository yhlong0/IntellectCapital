# Crucial Conversations

1. Crucial conversations:
    - opposing opinions
    - strong emotions
    - high stakes

2. Most leaders get it wrong, they think org productivity and performance are simply about policies,processes, structures or system, however it was in employee behavior, the key to real change lies in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process.
3. When people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a group's ability to make better decisions.
4. The first step to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails(trouble) us.
5. When CEO try to save cost and someone ask a hard question in front of many people. What you can say:
       - You know what, we need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. Thank you for taking the risk. I appreciate the trust it shows in me.(Acknowledged)
       - Admitted that we did not know what the project would cost and check the numbers. Explain building the office was a respone to marketing advice to boost the company's image and improve client confidence. **I have not managed this project as tightly as I'm asking you to manage yours.(admitted error)**
6. Before you get angry, keep asking yourself **what do I really want here, how would I behave if I really wanted these result.**
7. Mutual Purpose at risk:
        - Do others believe I care about their goal in this conversation?
        - Do they trust my motives?
