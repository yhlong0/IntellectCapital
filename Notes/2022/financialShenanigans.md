# Financial Shenanigans

### Earnings Manipulation

#### Inflating Current-Period Earnings (push more revenue into the current period or shift expenses to a later one)
1. Recording revenue too soon
2. Recording bogus(fake) revenue
3. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
4. Shifting current expenses to a later period.
5. Employing other techniques to hide expenses or losses

#### Inflating Future-Period Earnings (hold back today's revenue, accelerate tomorrow's expenses or loss into the current period)
1. Shifting current income to a later period
2. Shifting future expenses to the current period

#### Boomerang Transcation
1. When money flows in both directions, from seller to customer and from customer to seller.
2. The suspicious timing of press releases announcing new sales just after a period ended, as revenue should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract. 

#### Calendar Games
Be wary of companies that extend their quarter end date. 

#### Changing Accounting Policies to Keep the Streak Alive
When senior executives boast about an amazing record streak of performance, it is more likely that they will resort to financial shenanigans to keep that streak alive.

#### Percentage of Completion(POC)
When a company switches from standard revenue recognition practices to the more aggressive POC approach. Investors should be alert. 

#### Be alert for Up-Front Recognition of a Long-term License Contract
