# Financial Shenanigans

### Earnings Manipulation

#### Inflating Current-Period Earnings (push more revenue into the current period or shift expenses to a later one)
1. Recording revenue too soon
2. Recording bogus(fake) revenue
3. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
4. Shifting current expenses to a later period.
5. Employing other techniques to hide expenses or losses

#### Inflating Future-Period Earnings (hold back today's revenue, accelerate tomorrow's expenses or loss into the current period)
1. Shifting current income to a later period
2. Shifting future expenses to the current period

#### Boomerang Transcation
1. When money flows in both directions, from seller to customer and from customer to seller.
2. The suspicious timing of press releases announcing new sales just after a period ended, as revenue should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract. 

#### Calendar Games
Be wary of companies that extend their quarter end date. 

#### Changing Accounting Policies to Keep the Streak Alive
When senior executives boast about an amazing record streak of performance, it is more likely that they will resort to financial shenanigans to keep that streak alive.

#### Percentage of Completion(POC)
When a company switches from standard revenue recognition practices to the more aggressive POC approach. Investors should be alert. 

#### Be alert for Up-Front Recognition of a Long-term License Contract
#### Watch for Shipping Product to an Intermediary, Rather Than the Actual Customer
#### When a company switches from the more conservative sell-through(to actual users) to the sell-in(to a distribution network) approach, which of course inflates sales
#### A rapid increase in accounts receivable is often an indication of deteriorating financial health

1. Be extremely cautious when a company reports barter(易货贸易) or "nonmonetary" sales, especially when the buyer is a related party. Goods and services are swapped between two related parties. 
2. Question Revenue Recorded when cash is received in lending transacations, never confuse money received from your banker with money from a customer. 
3. Turning the sale of a business into a recurring revenue stream. A phone manufacturer decides no longer make its own batteries may sell its battery manufacturing division to another company and purchases batteries from that later. 

### Techniques to shift current expenses to a later period
1. Excessively capitalizing normal operating expenses
    - Unwarranted improvement in profit margins and a large jump in certain assets
    - A big unexpected decline in free cash flow, with an equally sizable increase in cash flow from operations
    - Unexpected increases in capital expenditures that belie the company's original guidance and market conditions
    - A new or unusual asset account, particularly one that is increasing rapidly, may signal improper capitalization
3. Amortizing costs too slowly
    - management decides to lengthen the amortization period.
5. Failing to write down assets with impaired value
    - compare the growth of inventory with revenue growth. If inventory growth far exceeds the sales growth, the inventory bulge is probably unwarranted and a concern for investors
    - watch for a decline in bad debts expense, previously has a lot of bad debts, now reduced a lot.
7. Failing to record expenses for uncollectible receivables and devalued investments

#### After buy Insurance policy, it is a asset at begining, then every year as expense from income statment, reduce the asset. 

#### Always view receive cash from vendors with suspicion. Cash normally flows out to vendors, not in from vendors. 

### Shift current income to a later period
1. Creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period(deferred earnings)
2. Smoothing income by improperly accounting for derivatives
3. Creating reserves in conjunction with an acquisition and releasing them intoincome in a later period
4. Recording current-period sales in a later period, fails to record revenue during the current period, storing it on the balance sheet until it is needed.
