# The Ride of a Lifetime

1. I tend to approach bad news as a problem that can be worked through and solved, something I have control over rather than something happening to me.
2. Spending time productively, that means reading or doing homework or being engaged in something that would "better" me in some way.
3. Wake early every morning to have time to think, read and exercise before the demands of the day take over. It's vital to create space in each day to let your thoughts wander beyond your immediate job responsibilities, to turn things over in your mind in a less pressured, more creative way than is possible once the daily triage(preliminary assessment, in order to determine the urgency) kicks in. 
4. Taking responsibility when you screw up, it's impossible not to make them, but it is possible to acknowledge them, learn from them. What's not okay is to undermine others by lying about something or covering your own ass first. 
5. Life is an adventure, if you don't choose the adventurous path, then you're not really living.
6. Know what you don't know, not to fake anything. You have to be humble, and you can't pretend to be someone you're not or to know something you don't. Do the work to learn what you need to learn as quickly as you can.
