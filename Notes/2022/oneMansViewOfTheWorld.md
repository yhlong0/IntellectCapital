# One man's view of the world

1. Chinese protestors for thousands of years. They know that opposing the central authority means certain annihilation. So they oppose wrongdoing by local officials while declaring loyalty to the centre. No one challenges the centre unless they are prepared to go all the way and take control of the whole country, which is most unlikely. 
2. Deng saw how a small island without natural resources was able to create a good life for his people by bringing in foreign investments, management, tech skills. Then he return China and open up its economy to the world.
3. For Taiwan, are the Americans prepared to fight, and fight, and fight again? Are they eventually prepared to pay the price that China is willing to pay over Taiwan? Remember that no Chinese leader can survive if Taiwan is lost under his watch. So for Chinese, it is a very serious matter. Even if they lose the first round, they will come back for a second round, then a third round and so on, until they win. It's not worth it for America. And Taiwan's people just gonna suffer until it ends. 
4. Thucydides famously wrote that the stong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.
