# The $100 Startup

1. The easiest way to understand skill transformation is to realize that you're probably good at more than one thing. 
2. Many business owners talk about their work in terms of the features it offers, but it's much more powerful to talk about the benefits customers receive.
3. An ounce of action is worth a ton of theory. 
4. When all else fails, ask yourself how you can help people more. 
5. Get started quickly and see what happens. There's nothing wrong with planning, but you can spend a lifetime making a plan that never turns into action. In the battle between planning and action, action wins. 
6. Almost everything that is being sold is for either a deep pain or a deep desire. 
7. Make sure your solution is different and better. It doesn't need to be cheaper--competing on price is usually a losing proposition.
