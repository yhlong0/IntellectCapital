# The $100 Startup

1. The easiest way to understand skill transformation is to realize that you're probably good at more than one thing. 
2. Many business owners talk about their work in terms of the features it offers, but it's much more powerful to talk about the benefits customers receive.
3. An ounce of action is worth a ton of theory. 
4. When all else fails, ask yourself how you can help people more. 
5. Get started quickly and see what happens. There's nothing wrong with planning, but you can spend a lifetime making a plan that never turns into action. In the battle between planning and action, action wins. 
6. Almost everything that is being sold is for either a deep pain or a deep desire. 
7. Make sure your solution is different and better. It doesn't need to be cheaper--competing on price is usually a losing proposition. 
8. FAQ is to provide reassurance to potential buyers and overcome objections. Your mission is to identify the main objections your buyers will have when considering your offer and carefully respond to them in advance.
9. Write the first three to five buyers to say thanks and ask did everything go OK in the order process? These buyers are probably your biggest fans anyway, so they'll appreciate the personal check-in. 
10. Marketing Plan: 
    - Contact two or three influential bloggers, create a custom dress(product, services) for them, which hopefully bring tons of new customers when they write about it.
    - Turn your attention toward your clients, upgrade their shipping to overnight for free
    - Double someone's order 
    - Include a copy of your favorite book/small gift with a handwritten note.
    - Package your products for shipping like a gift to your best friend.
