# The Effective Engineer

1. Instead of ask how should we do this, ask why do we need to do it at all?
2. To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact. 
3. Onboarding the new hires effectively would have a larger impact than any code I could produce. 
4. Each new engineer was paired up with a mentor for two to three months, and mentor was responsible for the new hire's success. Mentoring activities included:
    - reviewing code
    - outlining technical skills to learn
    - pair programming
    - discussing engineering tradeoffs
    - explaining how to prioritize better
    - offering guidance on how to work well with different team members.
    - plan a sequence of starter tasks and projects to increase the new hires' mastery of our systems. 
5. Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested
    - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity
    - By increasing the output of a particular activity
    - By shifting to higher-leverage activities(opportunity cost)

6. Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity for the effective engineer. Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more knowledge even faster. 
7. When companies pay you for cushy and unchallenging 9-to-5 jobs, what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous.
8. Google "20% time" rule, where engineers spend the equivalent of one day a week on a side project to make the company better. To invest in your own growth, you should carve out your own 20% time. It's more effective to take it in one- or two-hour chunks each day rather than in one full day each week.
9. Jump fearless into code you don't know.
10. Focus on the important and non-urgent, we're inundated every day with urgent requests demanding our attention: meetings, emails, phone calls, bugs, pager duty alerts, the next deadline. Some of these requests are important; others aren't. If we're not careful, our default script is to respond immediately to whatever urgent issues come our way. We let life's daily interruptions, rather than our priorities, dictate our schedules. 
11. If you have to do something manually more than twice, then write a tool for the third time.
12. The important of CICD, initially without invest time to CICD, person A will be faster, however as time goes, CICD will save more time for deployment in future, especially when more people join the project, the time saving is more. **Time-saving tools pay off large dividends** 
13. Fast tools get used more frequently and enable new development workflow that previously weren't possible. 
14. The next time you find yourself repeatedly going through the same motions when you're fixing a bug or iterating on a feature, pause. Take a moment to think through whether you might be able to tighten tat testing loop. It could save you time in the long run. 
15. Google at begining also use click through rate metrics to track if search result is useful or not, However, this is not a good metric, user might click bunch of them, but none of them are useful, and that's probably also the reason they click a lot to search for the useful thing. The best metrics to track user happiness is the top one "long click". This occurs when someone clicks a search result and doesn't return to the search page, or stays on the result page for a long time. 
16. Don't delay, get feedback. Figure out what's working, that's far better than tring to build something and then trust that you got everything right--because you can't get everything right.
17. "minimum viable product" (MVP) is a version of a new product which allows team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. 
18. The strategy of faking the full implementation of an idea to validate whether it will work is extreamly powerful. 
19. The most common dysfunction is that the team starts behaving like two teams and these two groups will only work on tasks on their side of the board. 
20. Make accurate time estimation:
    - Decompose the project into grannular tasks
    - Think as probability distributions, not best-case scenarios, 50 % likelihood we can deliver 4 weeks, 90% chance we can deliver it within 8 weeks. 
    - Let the person doing the actual task make the estimate
    - If a problem turns out to be harder than expected, it's better to find out and adjust the target date sooner rather than later. 
21. Idempotent: produces the same results regardless of whether it's run once or multiple times. It therefore can be retried as often as necessary without unintended side effects.
22. Netflix Chaos Monkey: randomly kills services in its own infrastructure during regular work hours, engineers can identify architectural weaknesses while they're in the office rather than having to deal with unexpected and untimely emergencies on the weekends or in the middle of the night. The best defense against major unexpected failures is to fail often. 
23. You are a senior engineer if you're making a whole team better, You're a principle engineer if you're making the whole company better, and you're distinguished if you're improving the industry.
24. Image you have a magic wand that can make every single person in your company succeed at their job by 120%. What would happen? If everyone knocked their job out of the park, the company would probably be a huge success and even if you did nothing else, you'd be sept along in the tide of success of everyone around you. **Investing in other people's success is important**
25. Assume you had a 20-day stretch where you interviewed one engineer per day. On avergae, you spent two hours of every day that month talking with a candidate, writing up feedback, and defriefing on whether to make an offer. It was exhausting. But if those 40 hours result in even just one additional hire, the 2,000+ hours of output that he or she would contribute per year would more than justify the cost. 
26. A good interview: First, screens for the type of people likely to do well on the team, Second, gets candidates excited about the team, the mission, and the culture. 
27. Share ownership of the code. You don't want to have a vacation at Hawaii vocalno while some production issue comes up and you are the only person to be able to fix it. The *bus factor*: the number of key people who can be hit by a bus before the rest of the team is nolonger able to keep the project going. When engineers are fungible, nobody is uniquely positioned to do one thing, anyone thing can be done by multiple people.
