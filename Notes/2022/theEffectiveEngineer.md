# The Effective Engineer

1. Instead of ask how should we do this, ask why do we need to do it at all?
2. To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact. 
3. Onboarding the new hires effectively would have a larger impact than any code I could produce. 
4. Each new engineer was paired up with a mentor for two to three months, and mentor was responsible for the new hire's success. Mentoring activities included:
    - reviewing code
    - outlining technical skills to learn
    - pair programming
    - discussing engineering tradeoffs
    - explaining how to prioritize better
    - offering guidance on how to work well with different team members.
    - plan a sequence of starter tasks and projects to increase the new hires' mastery of our systems. 
5. Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested
    - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity
    - By increasing the output of a particular activity
    - By shifting to higher-leverage activities(opportunity cost)

6. Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity for the effective engineer. Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more knowledge even faster.
