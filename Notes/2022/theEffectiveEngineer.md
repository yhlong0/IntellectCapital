# The Effective Engineer

1. Instead of ask how should we do this, ask why do we need to do it at all?
2. To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact. 
3. Onboarding the new hires effectively would have a larger impact than any code I could produce. 
4. Each new engineer was paired up with a mentor for two to three months, and mentor was responsible for the new hire's success. Mentoring activities included:
    - reviewing code
    - outlining technical skills to learn
    - pair programming
    - discussing engineering tradeoffs
    - explaining how to prioritize better
    - offering guidance on how to work well with different team members.
    - plan a sequence of starter tasks and projects to increase the new hires' mastery of our systems. 
5. Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested
    - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity
    - By increasing the output of a particular activity
    - By shifting to higher-leverage activities(opportunity cost)

6. Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity for the effective engineer. Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more knowledge even faster. 
7. When companies pay you for cushy and unchallenging 9-to-5 jobs, what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous.
8. Google "20% time" rule, where engineers spend the equivalent of one day a week on a side project to make the company better. To invest in your own growth, you should carve out your own 20% time. It's more effective to take it in one- or two-hour chunks each day rather than in one full day each week.
9. Jump fealess into code you don't know.
10. Focus on the important and non-urgent, we're inundated every day with urgent requests demanding our attention: meetings, emails, phone calls, bugs, pager duty alerts, the next deadline. Some of these requests are important; others aren't. If we're not careful, our default script is to respond immediately to whatever urgent issues come our way. We let life's daily interruptions, rather than our priorities, dictate our schedules. 
11. If you have to do something manually more than twice, then write a tool for the third time.
12. The important of CICD, initially without invest time to CICD, person A will be faster, however as time goes, CICD will save more time for deployment in future, especially when more people join the project, the time saving is more. **Time-saving tools pay off large dividends** 
13. Fast tools get used more frequently and enable new development workflow that previously weren't possible. 
14. The next time you find yourself repeatedly going through the same motions when you're fixing a bug or iterating on a feature, pause. Take a moment to think through whether you might be able to tighten tat testing loop. It could save you time in the long run. 
15. Google at begining also use click through rate metrics to track if search result is useful or not, However, this is not a good metric, user might click bunch of them, but none of them are useful, and that's probably also the reason they click a lot to search for the useful thing. The best metrics to track user happiness is the top one "long click". This occurs when someone clicks a search result and doesn't return to the search page, or stays on the result page for a long time. 
16. Don't delay, get feedback. Figure out what's working, that's far better than tring to build something and then trust that you got everything right--because you can't get everything right.
17. A "minimum viable product" (MVP). that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. 
18. The strategy of faking the full implementation of an idea to validate whether it will work is extreamly powerful.
