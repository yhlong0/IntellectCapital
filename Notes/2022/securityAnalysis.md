# Security Analysis

1. It is quite possible to decide by inspection that a woman is old enough to vote without knowing her age or that a man is heavier than he should be without knowing his exact weight.
2. Obstacles to success of the analyst: 1) the inadequancy or incorrectness of the data 2) the uncertainties of the future, 3) the irrational behavior of the market.
3. The past record affords at least a rough guide to the future. The more questionable this assumption, the less valuable is the analysis. 
4. Production and sales units, division sales, operating expenses, capital expenditures, inventories, properties owned.
5. A stockholder is an owner of the business and an employer of its officers. 
6. An investment is thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Otherwise it is speculative. 
7. A high coupon rate bond is not adequate compensation for the assumption of substantial risk of principal.
8. Bond safety 
    - not measured by specific lien or contractual rights, but by the ability of the issuer to meet all of its obligations
    - should be measured under depression conditions
    - deficient safety cannot be compensated for an abnormally high coupon rate
9. It's not easy to stay on the sidelines while others are busy getting rich.
10. Investment in common stocks based on threefold concept:
    - Suitable and established dividend return
    - A stable and adequate earnings record
    - A satisfactory backing of tangible assets
11. Investor should choose truly good business, when market crash and disasters around you, you should made a promise to avoid any stock that you would not feel comfortable holding through another 1987-like crash.
12. The market level of common stocks is governed more by their current earnings than by their long-term average. So current earnings should not be the primary basis of appraisal.
13. Buy common stocks at the low prices occasioned by temporarily reduced earnings and to sell them at inflated levels created by abnormal prosperity.
14. People who habitually purchase common stocks at more than about 20 times their average earnings are likely to lose considerable money in the long run.
15. When a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, then either the price is too low or the company should be liquidated.
16. All the people I know who've built wealth in the stock market have worked very hard at it.
