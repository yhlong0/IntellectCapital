# Freakonomics

1. California auto mechanics found they often passed up a small repair bill by letting failing cars pass emissions inspections.
2. the crimial rate is high around 90s, later it go down a lot and people think it is because of good economics and gun control, but it turn out abortion is one important key.
3. Sale your $300,000 house, 6% total commission, 3% for your agent, however 1.5% for his company, he only get 1.5%. Which is $4500. If he could be a bit more patient and try to sell it at $310,000, he only has a mere $150 extra. The owner will earn $9400 extra, that means the incentives for you two is not align. When agent sells their own house, they holds out for the best offer, house stay 10 extra days and usually sell 3% higher($10,000), when their sells yours, they encourages you to take the first decent offer that comes along.
4. Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life.
5. Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle causes. the women who fight for abortion law, help reduce the crimal rate. 
6. Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so.
7. When tax filling require SSN for the dependent child, suddenly, 7 million children who had existed before disappear. 
8. People will pay different amounts for the same item depending on who is providing it. Beer on the Beach, resort hotel vs shabby grocery store.
