# Cracking the Coding Interview

1. Interview feedback: Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication. 
2. Product Management: Handling Ambiguity, Customer Focus(Attitude, Technical Skills), Multi-level Communication, Passion for Technology, Teamwork.
3. Resume show what you did, how you did, and what the results were. Example:
    - reduced rendering time by 75% by implementing distributed caching, leading to a 10% reduction in log-in time.
    - increased average match accuracy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparision algorithim based on windiff. 
4. Describe skills/languages in plain English, don't list number of years of experience: JavaScript(expert), Python(proficient), Go(prior experience)
5. Interview Preparation, three projects, for each project talk about:
    - Challenges
    - Mistakes/Failures
    - Enjoyed
    - Leadership
    - Conflicts
    - What you'd do differently
    - 
6. **Focus on Yourself, Not your team**
7. Tell me about a xxx: Situation -> Action -> Result
8. O(x!) > O(2^x) > O(x^2) > O(xlog x) > O(x) > O(log x)
9. Need to know: 
    - Data Structures: linked lists, tree, tries, graphs, stack, queue, heap, vector/arraylists, hash table
    - Algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
    - Concepts: Bit Manipulation, Memory(Stack vs Heap), Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Big O Time & Space
10. Problem-solving flowchart: Listen -> Example -> Brute Force(state a naive algorithm and **its runtime**)->Optimize(**B**ottlenecks, **U**nnecessary Work, **D**uplicated Work) -> Walk Through your approach in detail -> Implement(keep talking) -> Test(code review, small test cases, edge cases, fix bug)
11. Keep Interviewing at least once a year, even if you aren't actively looking for a new job. This will keep your skill fresh and what opportunities/salaries are out there. 
12. Tree traversal(always left to right, if root is in the mid, it is in-order, if root is begining, it is pre-order)
    - in-order: left->root->right
    - pre-order: root->left->right
    - post-order: left->right->root
13. Heap: 
    - implement with array, root is smallest/biggest number.
    - insert, insert at the last position, bubble up
    - remove min/max, swap with the last, bubble down.
