# A Random Walk Down Wall Street

1. History of Bubbles, Tupli, South Sea Company, Before Great Depression, 60s electronic, 80 biotech, 2000 internet/.com, 2008 mortgage
2. publications that promised an easy road to rich, magazines featured stories such as "Internet stocks likely to double in the months ahead", it was "investment pornography", soft core rather than hard core, but pornography all the same. 
3. If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel(a Canadian multinational telecommunications and data networking equipment manufacturer) stock one year ago, it would now be worth $49. If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser(the beer, not the stock) one year ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit, you would have $79. My advice to you...start drinking heavily. 
4. The key to investing is not how much an industry will affect society or even how much it will grow, but rather its ability to make and sustain profits.
5. Bubbles are particularly dangerous when they are associated with a credit boom and widespread increases in leverage both for consumers and for financial institutions. 
6. The stock market is not a voting mechanism but a weighing mechanism. Valuation metrics have not changed. Eventually every stock can only be worth the present value of the cash flow it is able to earn for the benefit of investors.
7. There are special risks involved in buying "growth stock" when the market has already recognized the growth and has bid up the PE to a hefty premium over that accorded more run-of-the-mill stocks. If the growth does not materialize and earnings in fact go down or even grow more slowly than expected, you will take a very unpleasant bath. the grow stock double benefits can become double damages. 
8. The "cycles or momentum" in the stock charts are no more true cycles than the runs of luck or misfortune of the coin toss.(Use coin toss, you can generate all kinds of stock graph.)
9. Pro forma earnings are often called "earnings before all the bad stuff"
10. Beta, the key analytical tool of the capital-asset pricing model(CAPM), is not a useful single measure to capture the relationship between risk and return.
11. Inflation may benefit the prices of common stocks in the natural resource industries.
