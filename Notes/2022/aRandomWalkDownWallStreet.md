# A Random Walk Down Wall Street

1. History of Bubbles, Tupli, South Sea Company, Before Great Depression, 60s electronic, 80 biotech, 2000 internet/.com, 2008 mortgage
2. publications that promised an easy road to rich, magazines featured stories such as "Internet stocks likely to double in the months ahead", it was "investment pornography", soft core rather than hard core, but pornography all the same. 
3. If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel(a Canadian multinational telecommunications and data networking equipment manufacturer) stock one year ago, it would now be worth $49. If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser(the beer, not the stock) one year ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit, you would have $79. My advice to you...start drinking heavily. 
4. The key to investing is not how much an industry will affect society or even how much it will grow, but rather its ability to make and sustain profits.
