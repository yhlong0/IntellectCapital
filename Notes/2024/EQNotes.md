# EQ Notes

1. Our basic wiring for survival hinges on necessities like food, water, and shelter. Threats to these essentials elicit strong emotional reactions. This instinctual drive underlies our need for job security and a steady income to purchase food. Changes such as getting a new boss, undergoing performance reviews, or being assigned to a new team can activate these survival responses
2. Our inherent need to belong stems from ancient times when survival depended on being part of a group. Being integrated into a community significantly increased our chances of survival. We understand that being marginalized from a group can pose serious risks.
3. We are wired to become our best self. great to our potential and make the contribution we're here to make.
4. Set expectation, confirm/commit from other side, inspect the result, provide the feedback and consequence.
5. Accountability is like being part of a less sweaty, more stressful version of a relay race. First, you hand off the 'expectation baton'—make sure your teammate doesn't drop it while nodding like a bobblehead in agreement. Then, you put on your best coach's hat (or monocle, if you're feeling fancy) and scrutinize their every move as they sprint down the metaphorical track. After they cross the finish line, it’s feedback time! Roll out the red carpet or the rolled-up newspaper, depending on how things went. And remember, the consequence could be anything from a victory dance to a team meeting that feels longer than a marathon. Either way, it's all in the name of good fun... and productivity, of course!
