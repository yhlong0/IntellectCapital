# EQ Notes

1. Our basic wiring for survival hinges on necessities like food, water, and shelter. Threats to these essentials elicit strong emotional reactions. This instinctual drive underlies our need for job security and a steady income to purchase food. Changes such as getting a new boss, undergoing performance reviews, or being assigned to a new team can activate these survival responses
2. Our inherent need to belong stems from ancient times when survival depended on being part of a group. Being integrated into a community significantly increased our chances of survival. We understand that being marginalized from a group can pose serious risks.
3. We are wired to become our best self. great to our potential and make the contribution we're here to make.
