# The Everything Store

1. The regret minimization framework: When you are in the thick of things, you can get confused by small stuff, I knew when I was eighty that I would never think about why I walked away from my 1994 Wall Street bonus right in the middle of the year at the worst possible time. That kind of thing just isn't something you worry about when you're eighty years old. At the same time, I knew that I might sincerely regret not having participated in this thing called the Internet which I thought was going to be a revolutionizing event. When I thought about it that way...it was incredibly easy to make the decision.
2. Every time we hire someone, he or she should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool is always improving.
3. Personalization, great merchants have never had the opportunity to understand their customers ina truly individualized way, E-commerce is going to make that possible.
4. Bezos had predicted that chain retailers would have trouble competing online. They were reluctant to lose money on a relatively small part of their business and didn't want to put their most resourceful employees behind an effort that would siphon sales away from the more profitable stores. Their distribution operation was well entrenched and geared toward servicing physical stores by sending out large shipments of books to set number of locations. The shift from that to mailing small orders to individual customers was long, painful, and full of customer-service errors. For Amazon, that was just daily business.
5. Methodology for how to select the category: a SWAT team to research categories of products that had high SKUs were underrepresented in physical stores, and could easily be sent through the mail.
6. Bezos was looking for versatile managers who could move fast and get big things done.
7. Toys were different than books, music, or movies. There is no third-party distributors to provide any item and take back unsold inventory. The retailers had to predict nearly a year in advance what the next holiday season's most popular items would be, as a majority of their sales occurred within a six-week frenzy of parental indulgence. If the retailers' forecasts were wrong, they were in deep trouble, because after the holidays, unsold toys were nonreturnable and about as desirable as rotten fruit. Toys are so fad driven, it's a little like betting on Oscar winners only by looking at movie trailers.
