# The Everything Store

1. The regret minimization framework: When you are in the thick of things, you can get confused by small stuff, I knew when I was eighty that I would never think about why I walked away from my 1994 Wall Street bonus right in the middle of the year at the worst possible time. That kind of thing just isn't something you worry about when you're eighty years old. At the same time, I knew that I might sincerely regret not having participated in this thing called the Internet which I thought was going to be a revolutionizing event. When I thought about it that way...it was incredibly easy to make the decision.
2. Every time we hire someone, he or she should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool is always improving.
3. Personalization, great merchants have never had the opportunity to understand their customers ina truly individualized way, E-commerce is going to make that possible.
