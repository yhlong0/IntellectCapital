# The Latte Factor

1. When asked why people didn't save more or make retirement plan, they gave the same answer: 'Not enough income.' More income wouldn't help their situation at all. When people have more income, they just spend it on more stuff.
2. Pay yourself first.
3. You are richer than you think.
4. Make everything automatically. It is simple. That's why it works. It's usually the simplest idea that changes people's lives, not the complicated one.
5. Money, lifestyle, you build your health the same way you build your wealth, one bite at a time.
6. It takes money to make money, this is not true. You don't need a huge chunk of money to start building wealth.
7. The latte factor is not asking you to stop drinking lattes, it is not about your coffee. It is a metaphor. It could be anything you spend extra money on that you could happily do without. Cigarettes, a candy bar, fancy cocktails. It is not about being a penny-pincher or denying yourself. It's about getting clear on what matters, delayed gratification. If you could redirect those five, ten, twenty dollars a day toward your future, building things you want. It's about giving up something small to get up to something big.
