# The Latte Factor

1. When asked why people didn't save more or make retirement plan, they gave the same answer: 'Not enough income.' More income wouldn't help their situation at all. When people have more income, they just spend it on more stuff.
2. Pay yourself first.
3. You are richer than you think.

If you could redirect those five, ten, twenty dollars a day toward your future, building things you want. It's about giving up something small to get up to something big.

Identify what truly matters to you and pursue it with intention.

11. At the end of my journey, as I look back at the many times life presented me with a fork in the road—the safe path versus the risky one—If I choose the safer road, I realize they are tinged with regret. Each time, I turned away from the possibility of what could have been—a life perhaps filled with greater fulfillment and adventure. My advice? Choose the path that promises more joy, the one that makes your heart beat faster, even if it's lined with uncertainty.
