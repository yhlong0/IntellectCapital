# Data Driven Marketing

1. Marketing expenditures and their effectiveness are often not well measured, and the impact can be delayed. In challenging economic times, marketing budgets are usually the first to be cut due to this perceived lack of immediate results. However, effective marketing should be data-driven, allowing for tracking of results and impacts. Companies that continue or even increase their marketing spending during economic downturns tend to survive better.
2. Half the money I spend on marketing is wasted--the problem is I don't know which half.
3. An example of successful direct mail:
   - On the front, it features the recipient’s name, “Mark,” with a special invitation.
   - It knows the recipient’s interest in golf.
   - It includes a URL personalized with the recipient’s name at the end of the link, allowing for easy tracking of whether the user visited the link.
4. An example of marketing for the new Porsche Turbo Cabriolet product line:
	- A stamped “raw” metal plate was delivered to existing Turbo Cabriolet owners.
	- Recipients were provided with a personal login and encouraged to visit the website with the message: “The raw Porsche awaits your color selection.”
	- On the website, customers could choose their favorite color and order a personalized Turbo Cabriolet poster.
	- The campaign tracked key metrics, including:
		- Number of users who logged in
		- Average session duration
		- Number of posters ordered
		- Word-of-mouth impact
		- Number of “send to a friend” invitations
		- Response rate
		- Percentage of Turbo Cabriolet buyers during this period who received the mailer.
5. If you ask CMOs how they spend their budget, you often hear the percentage spent on TV, print, Internet and so on. However this breakdown is not useful, it does not tell what is the intended outcome of the marketing. We defined buckets for demand generation(drive revenues in a short time), branding and awareness(sports sponsorship, not to promote an upcoming sale), customer relationships(creating a personal link that drives loyalty and engagement), shaping markets(make the market receptive to your products or services through independent third-party recommendations) and infrastructure and capabilities.
6. Financial metrics can be used to quantify approximately 50 percent of marketing activities.
7. Good Marketing resource allocation, it spends more money on Branding, customer relationships, and infrastructure, rather than short-term demand generation.
8. Example: A bank initiated a marketing campaign to encourage customers to set up IRAs. Initially, they invested a small amount in collecting relevant data, which resulted in generating a new target list of the top 25 customers for each salesperson to contact(people who previously saved 5k+). Previously, only 1 out of 10 calls resulted in a successful setup, but with the new list, this improved to 8 out of 10. However, it took time for the sales team to recognize the value of the new list. In the first year, only 25% of the sales force participated, but by the third year, participation had increased to over 75%. This example demonstrates that new data-driven marketing experiments cannot simply be imposed from the top down. The goal was for salespeople to realize the effectiveness of the list and drive adoption from the ground up. The small IRA marketing initiative was the starting point. This success helped us build the business case and gain executive sponsorship for a much larger marketing initiative.
9. Think big, start small, and scale up fast.
10. Brand awareness, use surveys to ask how much more a person will be willing to pay for a branded versus the equivalent nonbranded product. This percentage difference multiplied by the product sales is approximately the value of the brand.
11. For the electric shaver, the theme was a sensuous female robot helping a guy shave with an electric shaver in the shower, obviously designed to appeal to the male demographic.
12. Have you seen, heard, or read anything about the following brands, use this kind of survey to measure brand or marketing awareness.
