# Data Driven Marketing

1. Marketing expenditures and their effectiveness are often not well measured, and the impact can be delayed. In challenging economic times, marketing budgets are usually the first to be cut due to this perceived lack of immediate results. However, effective marketing should be data-driven, allowing for tracking of results and impacts. Companies that continue or even increase their marketing spending during economic downturns tend to survive better.
2. Half the money I spend on marketing is wasted--the problem is I don't know which half.
3. An example of successful direct mail:
   - On the front, it features the recipient’s name, “Mark,” with a special invitation.
   - It knows the recipient’s interest in golf.
   - It includes a URL personalized with the recipient’s name at the end of the link, allowing for easy tracking of whether the user visited the link.
4. An example of marketing for the new Porsche Turbo Cabriolet product line:
	- A stamped “raw” metal plate was delivered to existing Turbo Cabriolet owners.
	- Recipients were provided with a personal login and encouraged to visit the website with the message: “The raw Porsche awaits your color selection.”
  - On the website, customers could choose their favorite color and order a personalized Turbo Cabriolet poster.
  - The campaign tracked key metrics, including:
      - Number of users who logged in
  	  - Average session duration
  	  - Number of posters ordered
  	  - Word-of-mouth impact
  	  - Number of “send to a friend” invitations
  	  - Response rate
  	  - Percentage of Turbo Cabriolet buyers during this period who received the mailer.
