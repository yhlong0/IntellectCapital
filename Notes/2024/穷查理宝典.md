# 穷查理宝典

1. 活到老学到老，对知识抱有好奇心，遇事冷静镇定，不心生妒忌和仇恨，言出必行，能从别人的错误中吸取教训，有毅力恒心，拥有客观的态度。为人诚实正直，做的总比份内事要多，而且从来不抱怨其他人做了什么。不对别人没做好的事情放马后炮。

10. The idea of earing that someone is making money faster than you are is one of the deadly sins. Envy is a really stupid sin because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There's a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?
11. How to get rich? How can I become like you except faster? Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day--if you live long enough--most people get what they deserve.

You could afford the very expensive cost of network television because you were selling so damn many cans and bottles. Some little guy couldn't. And there was no way of buying it in part. Therefore, he couldn't use it. The TV advertising was the most effective technique before. So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge tailwind. They prospered and prospered until some of them got fat and foolish, which happens with prosperity--at least to some people.
16. The people who sell the more efficient machinery, show you projections of the amount you'll save at current prices with the new technology.
