1. Milankovitch Cycles:
    - Eccentricity: This refers to changes in the shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Over a cycle of about 100,000 years, the Earth’s orbit changes shape from being more circular to more elliptical (oval) and back again. This affects the Earth's distance from the Sun and thus impacts the amount of solar energy the Earth receives.
    - Axial Tilt (Obliquity): The Earth's tilt on its axis varies between about 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees over roughly 41,000 years. This tilt influences the severity of the seasons, with greater tilt causing more severe seasonal contrasts and thus impacting the distribution of solar energy across the planet.
    - Precession: This is the change in the orientation of the Earth’s rotational axis which affects the timing of the seasons in relation to the Earth's closest and farthest point from the sun. This cycle takes about 19,000 to 23,000 years to complete. Because of precession, the timing of when the Earth is closest to the sun (perihelion) and farthest from the sun (aphelion) shifts across the calendar year, affecting seasonal contrasts.
