# The Astrophotography Manual

1. Large Apertures enable visual observation of dimmer objects and shorter exposures, they do not necessarily provide better resolution in typical seeing conditions. 
2. Large Aperture -> shorter exposures -> more sub-exposures in a given time -> improve signal-to-noise ratio.
3. Large Aperture does nothing to overcome the effect of light pollution.
