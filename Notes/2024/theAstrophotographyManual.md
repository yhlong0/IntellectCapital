# The Astrophotography Manual

1. Large Apertures enable visual observation of dimmer objects and shorter exposures, they do not necessarily provide better resolution in typical seeing conditions. 
2. Large Aperture -> shorter exposures -> more sub-exposures in a given time -> improve signal-to-noise ratio.
3. Large Aperture does nothing to overcome the effect of light pollution.
4. How long should you set the exposure? The upper limit is imposed by the ability of each photosite to store charge. Beyond this point, it is said saturated and there is no further signal increase with further exposure. Stars often saturate with long exposures and shorter exposures will be necessary to ensure they do not become white blobs. The read noise is going to be part of the decision making process for determining the minimum exposure. In summary, each exposure should be long enough so that the read noise does not dominate the shot noise from the incident light but short enough so that the important part of the image does not saturate.
5. With multiple exposures it is not a crisis if a few are thrown away for any number of singular events(guiding issue, cosmic-ray strike, satellite or aircraft trail etc).
