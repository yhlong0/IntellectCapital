# Artificial Intelligence

1. Hofstadter's terror was not about AI becoming too smart, too invasive, too malicious, or even too useful. Instead, he was terrified that intelligence, creativity, emotions, and maybe even consciousness itself would be too easy to produce--that what he valued most in humanity would end up being nothing more than a "bag of tricks" that a superficial set of brute force algorithms could explain the human spirit.
2. Once an AI masters human language skills, it will be in a position to expand its language skills and general knowledge by reading all human literature and absorbing the knowledge contained on millions of websites.
3. Influence of human physical body and emotions on our cognition. Perception of physical interaction with the environment shaping experience. Without the equivalent of a human body, and everything that goes along with it, a machine will never be able to learn all that's needed to pass the Turing test.
4. The core of the criticism is, that Oh Kurzweil is underestimating the complexity of reverse-engineering the human brain or the complexity of biology. But He thinks they're underestimating the power of exponential growth.
