# Only the Paranoid Survive

1. Mainframe computers are vertically integrated products. Companies need to develop the chassis, hardware, operating system, and software. In contrast, the PC era is characterized by horizontal integration, where each PC can be customized with a variety of options for each component. Recognizing and adapting to this shift is crucial.
2. When the "Intel Inside" campaign became highly successful, Intel didn't initially realize that they were now engaging directly with customers. Even minor imperfections in the CPU could result in significant costs and efforts to resolve.
3. When customers leave your platform, stop using your services, or are drawn to your competitors, it is crucial to understand the reasons behind their departure.
4. Intel's initial insight when founding the company was straightforward yet profound. They discovered that incorporating more transistors onto a single chip could be done at a relatively constant production cost. Additionally, placing transistors closer together not only reduces latency but also enhances processing speed. This approach offers two significant advantages to customers: lower costs and improved performance.
5. When a business undergoes a significant transformation, often referred to as a strategic inflection point, there is usually internal resistance due to emotional attachments to past practices. Existing management may wish to preserve their positions, which can lead to biases in decision-making. However, hiring an external CEO can bring more intellectual objectivity to the process, as they lack the emotional ties to the company's history.
6. Spend time listening to lower-level managers, When spring comes, snow melts first at the periphery because that's where it's most exposed. Factoring in the news from the periphery is an important contribution to the process of sorting out signals from noise.
7. If you're wrong, you will die. But most companies don't die because they are wrong. Most die because they don't commit themselves. They fritter away their momentum and their valuable resources while attempting to make a decision. The greatest danger is in standing still.
8. When is the right time to shift the resource? When the momentum of your existing strategy is still positive, your business is still growing, and your customers and complementors still think highly of you yet thereâ€™s enough evidence of blips on your radar screen to warrant, at a minimum, exploring their significance. If your exploration confirms that they are real and are gaining, shift more resources onto them.
