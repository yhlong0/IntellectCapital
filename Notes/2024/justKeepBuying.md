# Just Keep Buying

1. What should I invest in? Am I saving enough? Should I buy it now or wait it out? Shortly thereafter, I saw a YouTube video that changed everything. 3 words that got me to 3M subs discussed how to grow the channel using three words of advice -- **Just Keep Uploading**
2. For young investors with only $1,000 in their investment account, the specifics of their investment strategy and the amount of time spent on research may not significantly impact their financial growth. Even with a 10% annual return, the earnings could be quickly offset by everyday expenses, especially in high-cost areas like New York City. For instance, a single night out for dinner and a ride home with Uber might consume an entire year's worth of investment gains. In such scenarios, focusing on saving more or increasing earnings can be far more effective. Conversely, for someone with a $10 million portfolio, a 10% market decline could mean a $1 million loss, a sum that's virtually impossible to recoup through savings alone. Saving is for the poor and investing is for the rich.
3. The 2x Rule: If I want to buy a $400 pair of dress shoes, I would also have to buy $400 worth of stocks(or other income-producing assets). This makes me re-evalutate how much I want something.
4. When you get a raise, how much should you spend? 50%. For high savers, spending more of your raise will delay your retirement, because you increase your lifestyle and you need to save more. but for lower savers, this is the reverse.
5. The crossover point rule: When can you retire, find the point when your monthly investment income exceeds your monthly expense.
6. We buy stocks so we can eat well, but we buy bonds so we can sleep well.
7. If you are worried about investing a large sum of money right now, the problem may be that you're considering a portfolio that is too risky for your liking. Buying now is "better" than the dollar cost average based on historical data. Another way you could improve this is select a conservative portfolio to buy a large sum of money now, then every year switch to a bit more aggressive portfolio set up.
