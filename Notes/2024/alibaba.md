# Alibaba

1. Iron Triangle: e-commerce, logistics, and finance.
2. Customer first, employee second, shareholder last.
3. Jack Ma embarked on his English learning journey by conversing with foreigners outside a hotel and volunteering as a tour guide to hone his language skills. Despite facing academic challenges and not excelling in exams, he pursued a career as an English teacher. His job hunt was fraught with rejections, yet his proficiency in English opened a door to a pivotal encounter. It enabled him to befriend visitors from Australia, maintaining these connections which eventually led to an opportunity to travel abroad. This experience broadened his horizons, exposing him to the stark contrasts between China and the Western world, and significantly expanding his worldview.
4. While teaching at a school, he ventured into a side business offering translation services. This entrepreneurial spirit eventually led him to the United States, where he encountered the internet for the first time. Captivated by this new technology, he purchased a 486 computer and brought it back to China, marking the beginning of a new chapter in his journey
5. The dark days of 2001-2002 would later become part of Alibaba lore. At that time, Jack's slogan was to be the last man standing. If I had difficulties, there must be someone who had worse difficulties; If I had a hard time, my opponents had an even harder time. Those who can stand and manage will win eventually. 
6. Why eBay failed in China:
    - User Experience:
         - Advantages of a Local Site: fast release cycles, no long delays, enabling easy scheduling of maintenance during low-traffic times.
         - advantages of a global site: avoids censorship, a singular feature rollout can be made quickly available worldwide.
         - disadvantage of a global site: migration costs can be significant, and minor changes may accumulate, leading to long release times.
         - inadequate payment system: PayPal's late entry and China's restrictions on foreign financial solutions were significant drawbacks.
    - Internal Communication:
        - lack of knowledge sharing: The Taiwan team had a valuable experience that wasn't shared with the Shanghai team during the migration to a global site.
        - poor executive communication: Despite top management's belief in the importance of the Chinese market, poor communication led to a lack of awareness and timely problem-solving.
        - misalignment with local needs: Decisions made by US-based VPs and directors failed to consider the unique aspects of the Chinese market, highlighting a disconnect from local requirements.
