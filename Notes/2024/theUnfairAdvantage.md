# The Unfair Advantage

1. Success in the startup world is not simply awarded to the hardest workers. It is awarded to those who develop and use their Unfair Advantages.
2. Most startups fail, not because they can't build a product. But because they can't get traction.
3. One of the secrets to the success of Oprah's daytime TV shows is empathy, and compassion, which her traumatic childhood probably helped her develop. Every disadvantage can have a corresponding advantage, and vice versa.
4. God grants me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
