# Zero To One

1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them. It's easier to copy a model than to make something new: doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. Every new creation goes from 0 to 1.
2. What important truth do very few people agree with you on? Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x. 
3. What can we learn from the dot-com crash?
    - Grand visions inflated the bubble, anyone who claims to be able to change the world should be more humble and we should suspect. **Small incremental steps are the only safe path forward**
    - All companies must be "lean", you should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead, you should try things out, iterate, and treat entrepreneurship as experimentation.
    - Don't try to create a new market. Start with an already existing customer, and build your company by improving recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.
    - If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it's not good enough.
5. By "monopoloy", we mean the kind of company that's so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. 
6. Monoploy is good. Good Monoploy usually pretends to have a lot of competition while the hard competition companies pretend they have an advantage.
