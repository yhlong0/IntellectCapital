# The Hard Thing About Hard Things

1. When I was a child, another boy named Roger tried to force me to do something harmful to a kid named Joel. I was terrified—if I refused, Roger might beat me, but if I complied, I would hurt Joel and face the consequences. In the end, I approached Joel and asked if I could ride in his wagon, and we became best friends. Being scared doesn't mean you're gutless; what matters is your actions, which determine whether you become a hero or a coward. Had I followed Roger's orders, I would have never met my best friend. This experience also taught me not to judge things by their surface. Until you make an effort to get to know someone or something, you know nothing. There are no shortcuts to knowledge, especially that gained from personal experience. Following conventional wisdom and relying on shortcuts can be worse than knowing nothing at all.

3. I had a great deal of trouble sleeping as I thought about our fate. I tried to make myself feel better by asking, "What’s the worst thing that could happen?" The answer always came back the same: "We’ll go bankrupt, I’ll lose everybody’s money including my mother’s, I’ll have to lay off all the people who have been working so hard in a very bad economy, all of the customers who trusted me will be screwed, and my reputation will be ruined." Funny, asking that question never made me feel any better. “Then one day I asked myself a different question: “What would I do if we went bankrupt?” The answer that I came up with surprised me: "I’d buy our software, Opsware, which runs in Loudcloud, out of bankruptcy and start a software company."
4. Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.
5. Training is one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Consider you put 3 hours of preparation for each hour of course time, twelve hours of work in total. Assume you have ten students in your class. Each employee works about twenty thousand hours for your organization. If your training efforts result in a 1 percent improvement in your subordinates' performance, your company will gain the equivalent of two hundred hours of work as the result of the expenditure of your twelve hours.
6. When people interview managers, they often like to ask, Have you fired anyone? Or how many people have you fired? Or how would you go about firing someone? These are all fine questions, but often the right question is the one that isn’t asked: When you fired the person, how did you know with certainty that the employee both understood the expectations of the job and was still missing them? The best answer is that the manager clearly set expectations when she trained the employee for the job. If you don’t train your people, you establish no basis for performance management. As a result, performance management in your company will be sloppy and inconsistent.
7. A good QA cannot build a high-quality product, but it can tell you when the development team builds a low-quality product. Similarly, a high-quality HR cannot make you a well-managed company with a great culture, but it can tell you when you and your managers are not getting the job done.
