# The Facebook Effect

1. Facebook's ultimate success owes a lot to the fact that it began at college. That's where people's social networks are densest and where they generally socialize more vigorously than at any other time in their lives.
2. Harvard confers an imprimatur that carries unique weight in any field. A Harvard connection makes a product less suspect. To join a social network that began at Harvard might seem perfectly natural to anyone with a high opinion of himself. That was an important early dynamic.
3. The strategic growth of Facebook is a prime example of judicious scaling. They meticulously monitored site usage and strategically chose when to expand to new schools. In instances where traffic spiked or system performance issues arose, and the budget did not permit new server acquisitions, they opted to delay expansion. This cautious approach was a notable strength for a financially constrained web startup, emphasizing the importance of not compromising user experience for rapid growth. Despite being managed by a relatively inexperienced team, Facebook's growth was methodical rather than hasty. They refrained from seeking excessive investment for immediate scaling. Instead, they focused on enhancing server capacity by tenfold before considering expansion to a new campus, intentionally moderating their growth pace in the early stages. This strategy underscored a commitment to solidifying infrastructure and ensuring a seamless user experience above all.
4. Having an experienced individual guide you through the process of establishing your corporation's structure and negotiating with venture capitalists is essential. For instance, it's advisable to include additional board members, allowing the CEO or another founder to appoint someone specifically to safeguard voting interests. It's also crucial to determine the appropriate size of the option pool, among other considerations.
5. Allowing upload photos and tagging the people is a big success.
6. The News Feed is a significant innovation, transforming how friends stay informed about each other's lives. Rather than actively manually checking, now friends can simply subscribe to receive the latest news. This feature taps into users' eagerness to know what's new, what's changed, and what events have occurred in their friends' lives. It streamlines the previously time-consuming task of manually checking friends' profiles into an efficient, engaging activity. Yet, this innovation introduces challenges ranging from technical to ethical. With each user having an average of over 100 friends, tracking changes and tailoring content to individual interests is complex. Moreover, it sparked unexpected protests from users who felt it encouraged stalking and was intrusive. Despite initial backlash, subsequent data revealed an increase in Facebook usage once the News Feed feature was activated. Interestingly, the protests underscored the feature's appeal; despite vocal criticisms, the data confirmed users' strong, albeit conflicted, desire for it.
7. A good interview question: How to create a news feed? Machine learning, monitoring activities from each friend, sort things by what user might be interested.
8. Creating APIs, and making Facebook a platform for other developers to develop apps is a great success. Games are the most successful type of application, drawing in phenomenal numbers of players. It makes sense since gaming is a fundamentally social activity. Facebook enables you to play any game with any of your friends on the service.
9. When Yahoo expanded into Asia, it deployed large teams to each country, emphasizing a traditional approach to internationalization. In contrast, Facebook's foray into the Asian market redefined the norms of global expansion. Leveraging its scalable platform, Facebook demonstrated that technology can transcend traditional barriers to internationalization. The principle 'write once, run everywhere' not only simplified their expansion but also turned scale into a strategic advantage. This approach has allowed Facebook to rapidly and efficiently extend its reach across Asia without the need for extensive localized teams.
