# The Facebook Effect

1. Facebook's ultimate success owes a lot to the fact that it began at college. That's where people's social networks are densest and where they generally socialize more vigorously than at any other time in their lives.
2. Harvard confers an imprimatur that carries unique weight in any field. A Harvard connection makes a product less suspect. To join a social network that began at Harvard might seem perfectly natural to anyone with a high opinion of himself. That was an important early dynamic.
3. The strategic growth of Facebook is a prime example of judicious scaling. They meticulously monitored site usage and strategically chose when to expand to new schools. In instances where traffic spiked or system performance issues arose, and the budget did not permit new server acquisitions, they opted to delay expansion. This cautious approach was a notable strength for a financially constrained web startup, emphasizing the importance of not compromising user experience for rapid growth. Despite being managed by a relatively inexperienced team, Facebook's growth was methodical rather than hasty. They refrained from seeking excessive investment for immediate scaling. Instead, they focused on enhancing server capacity by tenfold before considering expansion to a new campus, intentionally moderating their growth pace in the early stages. This strategy underscored a commitment to solidifying infrastructure and ensuring a seamless user experience above all.
