Anything You Want

1. We've all heard about the importance of persistence. But I had misunderstood. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing wwhat's not working. (same as taking deep sky photos, keep improving is the key)
2. When the author was learning to sing, his instructor challenged him to stretch his abilities—singing an octave higher, then lower, and even doubling the speed. Initially, he doubted his capacity to comply, but his teacher encouraged him to proceed regardless. This parallels the dynamic nature of business; adherence to a single method is a limiting belief. The initial idea is merely a starting point among a multitude of possibilities. No business venture unfolds exactly as anticipated, thus devising ten radically diverse strategies. This concept applies equally to life's journey—exploring various avenues can lead to unexpected and rewarding destinations.
3. How do you grade yourself? For some people it is how much money they make, for others, it's how much money they give, it's important to know in advance, to make sure you're staying focused on what's honestly important to you, instead of doing what others think you should.
4. When one employee can't focus and spends his time surfing the web, instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall, It's important to resist that, it punishes everyone. Step back to look at the big picture, in the moment, you're angry, focusing only on that one awful person, Your thinking is clouded. You start believing everyone is awful and the whole world is against you. This is a horrible time to make a new policy.
5. Prepare to double, no matter what business you're in, it's good to prepare for what would happen if business doubled. Never be the tragic small business that freaked out when the business is doing well, it sends a repulsive "I can't handle this!" message to everyone. Instead, your internal processes are always designed to handle twice your existing load.
6. “When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won’t understand. They’ll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.
But that’s forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. Yes, it may take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you millions of dollars in lost opportunities because your business is growing slower because you’re insisting on doing something yourself. But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy! That’s it! You might get bigger faster and make millions if you outsource everything to the experts. But what’s the point of getting bigger and making millions? To be happy, right? In the end, it’s about what you want to be, not what you want to have. To have something (a finished recording, a business, or millions of dollars) is the means, not the end. To be something (a good singer, a skilled entrepreneur, or just plain happy) is the real point. When you sign up to run a marathon, you don’t want a taxi to take you to the finish line.”
