1. People often ignored the relevant statistical facts(not use System 2) and relied exclusively on resemblance(System 1).We used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on heuristic caused predictable biases(systematic errors) in their predictions. 
2. A chief investment officer invested tens of millions of dollars in Ford stock, when I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had attened an auto show and had been impressed. "they know how to make a car!". He had appraently not considered the one question that is ford stock currently underpriced. 
3. When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot. we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. 
4. When you use system 2, your muscles tensed up, your blood pressure rose, your pupils dilated, and your heart rate increased. As soon as you ended your work or when you gave up, your pupils contraced back to normal size. 
5. System 1 operates automatically and quickly with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
6. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. It often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
7. The invisible gorilla, intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind.
