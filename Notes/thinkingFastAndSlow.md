# Thinking, Fast and Slow

1. People often ignored the relevant statistical facts(not use System 2) and relied exclusively on resemblance(System 1).We used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on heuristic caused predictable biases(systematic errors) in their predictions. 
2. A chief investment officer invested tens of millions of dollars in Ford stock, when I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had attened an auto show and had been impressed. "they know how to make a car!". He had appraently not considered the one question that is ford stock currently underpriced. 
3. When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot. we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. 
4. When you use system 2, your muscles tensed up, your blood pressure rose, your pupils dilated, and your heart rate increased. As soon as you ended your work or when you gave up, your pupils contraced back to normal size. 
5. System 1 operates automatically and quickly with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
6. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. It often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
7. The invisible gorilla, intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind. 
8. "Law of least effort" applied to cognitive as well as physical exertion. If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.
9. Self-control requires attention and effort. Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs.
10. Ego depletion -- if you have had to force yourself todo something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. Or if you tired and hungry, you tend to fall back on the easier default selection.(Hungry judge for parole)
11. Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.
12. Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called "engaged." They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions. The psychologist Keith Stanovich would call them more rational. 
13. Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification. 
14. Ideomotor Effect--The words related to old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless. If you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age. 
15. The effect of repetition on liking is a profoundly important biological fact. To survive in a dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, however, the repeated exposure of a stimulus followed by nothing bad, such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal.
16. Creativity is associative memory that works exceptionally well. 
17. A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. 
18. The two headlines for stock news look like explanations of what happened in the market, in fact, all it does to satisfy our need for coherence, automatic search for causality: a large event is supposed to have consequences, and consequences need causes to explain them. 
19. Halo Effect--The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person--including things you have not observed. The first impression is the best impression.
