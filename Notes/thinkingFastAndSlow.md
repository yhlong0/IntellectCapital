# Thinking, Fast and Slow

1. People often ignored the relevant statistical facts(not use System 2) and relied exclusively on resemblance(System 1).We used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on heuristic caused predictable biases(systematic errors) in their predictions. 
2. A chief investment officer invested tens of millions of dollars in Ford stock, when I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had attened an auto show and had been impressed. "they know how to make a car!". He had appraently not considered the one question that is ford stock currently underpriced. 
3. When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot. we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. 
4. When you use system 2, your muscles tensed up, your blood pressure rose, your pupils dilated, and your heart rate increased. As soon as you ended your work or when you gave up, your pupils contraced back to normal size. 
5. System 1 operates automatically and quickly with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
6. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. It often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
7. The invisible gorilla, intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind. 
8. "Law of least effort" applied to cognitive as well as physical exertion. If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.
9. Self-control requires attention and effort. Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs.
10. Ego depletion -- if you have had to force yourself todo something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. Or if you tired and hungry, you tend to fall back on the easier default selection.(Hungry judge for parole)
11. Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.
12. Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called "engaged." They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions. The psychologist Keith Stanovich would call them more rational. 
13. Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification. 
14. Ideomotor Effect--The words related to old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless. If you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age. 
15. The effect of repetition on liking is a profoundly important biological fact. To survive in a dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, however, the repeated exposure of a stimulus followed by nothing bad, such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal.
16. Creativity is associative memory that works exceptionally well. 
17. A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. 
18. The two headlines for stock news look like explanations of what happened in the market, in fact, all it does to satisfy our need for coherence, automatic search for causality: a large event is supposed to have consequences, and consequences need causes to explain them. 
19. Halo Effect--The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person--including things you have not observed. The first impression is the best impression.
20. The initial traits change the very meaning of the traits that appear later.(第一印象非常重要) Evaluating people as attractive or not is a basic assessment. You do that automatically whether or not you want to, and it influences you. 
21. If you can't solve a problem, you will try to find a easier problem to solve, which sometimes work fairly well and sometimes leads to serious errors and biases.
22. Extreme outcomes(both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples. 
23. I won't believe that the new trader is a genius before consulting a statistician who could estimate the likelihood of his streak being a chance event. 
24. Anchoring Effect--It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. 
25. Availability Bias--people remember their own contributions much more than those of the others. The difference in availability leads to a difference in judged frequency, victims are very concerned after a disaster.
26. The emotional tail wags the rational dog.
27. An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government actions.
28. The ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight--nothing in between. 
29. success = talent + hardwork + luck; great success = a little more talent + a more hardwork + a lot of luck
30. The more extreme the original score(in golf), the more regression we expect, because an extremely good score suggests a very lucky day.
31. Olympic TV commenter keep giving causal explanations to indicate regression to the mean, however there is no need to looking for that, regression to the mean is the reason.
32. If your predictions are unbiased, you will never have the satisfying experience of correctly calling an extreme case. You will never be able to say, "I thought so!". Givien the limitations of the evidence, a venture capitalist will never be told that the probability of success for a start-up in its early stages is "very high".
33. When a VC looks for "the next big thing," the risk of missing the next Google or Facebook is far more important than the risk of making a modest investment in a start-up that ultimately fails. The goal of VCs is to call the extreme cases correctly, even at the cost of overestimating the prospects of many other ventures. For a conservative banker making large loans, the risk of a single borrower going bankrupt may outweigh the risk of turning down several would-be clients who would fulfill their obligations. 
34. The rational venture capitalist knows that even the most promising start-ups have only a moderate chance of success. 
35. That start-up achieved an outstanding proof of concept, but we shouldn't expect them to do as well in the future. They are still a long way from the market and there is a lot of room for regression. 
36. Hindsight bias has pernicious effects on the evaluations of decision makers. It leads observers to assess the quality of a decision not by whether the process was sound but by whether its outcome was good or bad. (low-risk surgical, unpredictable accident caused the patient's death) We are prone to blame decision makers for good decisions that worked out badly(新冠民众指责政府初期反应不够迅速，但是这是事后偏见)。The worse the consequence, the greater the hindsight bias.
37. Hindsight bias also bring undeserved rewards to irresponsible risk seekers, such as an entrepreneur who took a crazy gamble and won. Leaders who have been lucky are never punished for having taken too much risk. Instaed, they are believed to have had the flair(天赋，洞察力) and foresight to anticipate success. 
38. Illusion of validity--Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to tkae admissions of uncertainty seriously, but declarations of high confidence maily tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true. 
39. It is not unusual for more than 100 million shares of a single stock to change hands in one day. People all have same information, they buy and sell because they have different opinions. The puzzle is why buyers and sellers alike think that the current price is wrong. What makes them believe they know more about what the price should be than the market does? For most of them, that belief is an illusion. 
40. People who sell current stock and buy another one, it turns out recent winners tend to do better than recent losers in the short run. 
41. Professional investors, fund managers fail a basic test of skill: persistent achievement. If individual differences in any one year are due entirely to luck, the ranking of investors and funds will vary erratically and the year-toyear correlation will be zero. Where there is skill, the rankings will be more stable. 
42. Whenever we can replace human judgement by a formula, we should at least consider it. A simple combination of scores could probably do better. 
43. Recognition Prime Decision(RPD) model, first phase, a tentative plan comes to mind, next phase is a deliberate process in which the plan is mentally simulated to check if it will work. 
44. The situation has provided a cue, this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than ecognition. Intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.
45. The likelihood that something will go wrong in a big project is high, taking an "outside view" and is the cure to the planning fallacy. 
46. 10% exceed, 10% below, 80% in range prediction, the wide confidence interval is a confession of ignorance, which is not socially acceptable for someone who is paid to be knowledgeable in financial matters.
47. Always thinking inversion, image that we are a year into the future, we implemented the plan, however, the outcome was a diaster. Take 5 - 10 minutes to write that possible disaster.
48. keep giving 1 million to you, you will feel less happier compare to first time get a million. Diminishing utility of wealth. 由于边际效益递减，给你更多的钱不能产生更多的快乐，所以你会倾向于选择确定性高的，避免损失。（人们产生了风险厌恶？？）
49. 穷人买保险是风险厌恶的体现？因为对于穷人来说，损失会很惨重，避免风险，选择买保险。
50. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.(风险厌恶来自于生物进化)
51. The Endowment Effect--once he owns it, he considers the pain of giving up the stuff. If he doesnt own it, he considers the pleasure of getting the stuff.
52. The brains of humans and other animals contain a mechanism that is desgined to give priority to bad news. A single cockroach will completedly wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches. Negative trumps the positive in many ways. 
53. Bad emotions, parents, feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. 
54. The long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive. A friendship or company brand that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single action.
55. Negotiations over a shrinking pie are especially difficult, because they require an allocation of losses. People tend to be much more easy going when they bargain over an expanding pie. 
56. When tesla reduce the price, the losses for existing customer is more painful. 
57. When an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves. 
58. The fourfold pattern
    - 95% chance to win $1000 vs 100% get $900, people will prefer the later. 
    - 5% chance to win $1000 vs 100% chance to get $60 (lottery ticket, risk seeking, when price is very large, buyers appear indifferent to the fact that their chance of winning is minuscule, without ticket you can't win, with a ticket you have the right to dream pleasantly of winning)
    - 5% chance to loss $1000 vs buy $60 insurance to avoid loss
    - 95% chance to loss $1000 vs pay $900 to settle. (Reject favorable settlement and risk seeking, hope to avoid loss) Gambler who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss.

59. How terrorism works and why it is so effective? It induces an availability cascade, An extremely vivid image of death and damage, constantly reinforced by media attention and frequent conversations, becomes highly accessible, especially if it is associated with a specific situation such as the sight of a bus.
60. Denominator neglect, drawing a marble from one of two urns, in which red marbles win a prize: Urn A contains 10 marbles, of which 1 is red. vs Urn B contains 100 marbles, of which 8 are red. 
61. The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse. Investor can avoid that curse by reducing the frequency with which they check how well their investments are doing. Closely following daily fluctuations is a losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasure of the qually frequent small gains. Once a quarter is enough. 
62. Each of our executives is loss averse in his or her domain. That's perfectly natural, but the result is that the organization is not taking enough risk.
63. Sell winner or loser? A rational investor would have a comprehensive view of the portfolio and sell the stock that is least likely to do well in the future, without considering whether it is a winner or a loser. 
64. Sunk-cost fallacy -- The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account. fourfold pattern top-right cell of 95% chance to loss $1000, risk seeking. 65. Joint evaluation vs single evaluation, the number of entries is given no weight in single evaluation, because the numbers are not "evaluable" on their own. In joint evaluation, it is immediately obvious that second option is superior on this attribute, and number of entries is far more important than the condition of the cover. 
    - number of entries 10,000, Like new
    - number of entries 20,000, Cover torn, otherwise like new
66. The xxx units meant nothing until you saw how much this units vary. Joint evaluation was essential, it is often the case that when you broden the frame, you reach more reasonable decisions. 
67. People will more readily forgo a discount than pay a surcharge. The two may be economically equivalent, but they are not emotionally equivalent.
68. Went to see movie, lost ticket vs lost money, whatever you lost, the relevant fact is that you are less walthy than before you open the wallet.
69. MPG is kind of misleading, 12 mpg -> 14 mpg actually save more compare to 30 mpg to 40 mpg. 
70. Peak-end rule -- The level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and as its end.
71. Duration neglect: The duration of the procedure had no effect what soever on the ratings of total pain. 
72. The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing? Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones. 
73. Focus illusion -- Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.
