# The Millionaire Next Door

1. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.
2. How to determine if you're wealthy? Wealth personal net worth >= your age * realized pretax income / 10
3. It is unfortunate that some people judge others by their choice in foods, beverages, suits, watches, motor vehicles and such. Decamillionaire don't drink 1970 Bordeaux wine, pates or caviar.
4. Why would someone who is a millionaire need to budget? They became millionaires by budgeting and controlling expenses, and they maintain their affluent status the same way. People whom jogging day after day, they are the ones who seem not to need jog, but that's why they are fit. Those who are walthy work at staying financially fit. But those who are not financially fit do little to change their status. 
5. If you're not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household's total annual realized income.
6. There is an inverse relationship between the time spent purchasing luxury items such as cars and clothes and the time spent planning one's financial future.
7. Life has its own burdens. Why add excess baggage? Once you own Rolls Royce, you can't drive it to fishing, can't throw fish on back seat, already have one car, worker will alienate from him and thinking he exploited them, can't eat at crummy restaurants. 
8. Entrepreneurs become wealthy by taking substantial risks and by leveraging the labor and talent of dozens, even hundreds, of others. Normal person has limited time and resources, three level of leverage:
    - Borrow money, build a factory to increase the speed of accumulate wealth
    - Hire more people to leverage on time
    - Allocate your money to a capable person or company. Invest stock.
9. UAWs usually think they have more wealth than their neighbors. Many UAWs also believe that people drive the best they can afford.
10. Adults who sit around waiting for the next dose of economic outpatient care typically are not very produtive. Cash gifts are too oftem earmarked for consumption and the support of an unrealistically high lifestyle. 
11. Smart rich parents subsidizing their children's education and earmarking gifts so their children can start or enhance a business. 
12. Dumb rich parents earmarked for consumption and the propping up of a certain lifestyle and this is the single most factor that children lack of productivity. 
13. Buy home/car for kids increase their consumption level, make them insensitive to the price, feel their parents wealth is their income, income to be spent, from a focus on self-generated economic achievement to one of hoping for and contemplating the arrival of additional gifts. 
14. Son of affluent couple screams, when parents donate their wealth. For this kind of son, his income is depends on parents wealth, so when parents donate, it is equal to reduce the salary for them. This kind of son often feel they earned every dollar they have and they frequently use credit vehicles to smooth out their cash flow problems, never learn delay gratification.
