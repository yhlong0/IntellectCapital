# The Millionaire Next Door

1. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting walthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.
2. How to determine if you're wealthy? Wealth personal net worth >= your age * realized pretax income / 10
3. It is unfortunate that some people judge others by their choice in foods, beverages, suits, watches, motor vehicles and such. Decamillionaire don't drink 1970 Bordeaux wine, pates or caviar.
4. Why would someone who is a millionaire need to budget? Thye became millionaires by budgeting and controlling expenses, and they maintain their affluent status the same way. People whom jogging day after day, they are the ones who seem not to need jog, but that's why they are fit. Those who are walthy work at staying financially fit. But those who are not financially fit do little to change their status.
