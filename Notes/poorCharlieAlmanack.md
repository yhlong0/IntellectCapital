2. Independence -- Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked
  - Objeectivity and rationality require independence of thought
  - Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn't make you right or wrong--the only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judement.
  - Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean(merely average performance)

3. Preparation -- The only way to win is to work, work, work and hope to have a few insights
  - Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading, cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day
  - More important than the will to win is the will to prepare
  - Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines

4. Intellectual humility -- Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom 
  - Stay within a well-defined circle of competence
  - Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence
  - Resist the carving for false precision, false certainties, etc.
  - Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool
 
5. Analytic rigor -- Use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and omissions
  - Determine value apart from price, progress apart from activity, wealth apart from size.
  - It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric
  - Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst
  - Consider totality of risk and effect, look always at potential second order and higher level impacts.
  - Think forwards and backwards--always invert

6. Allocation -- Proper allocation of capital is an investor's number one job
  - Remember that highest and best use is always measured by the next best use(opportunity cost)
  - Good ideas are rare, when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet heavily
  - Don't "fall in love" with an investment--be situation-dependent and opportunity-driven

  - "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world", never interrupt it unnecessarily
  - Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs; never take action for its own sake.
  - Be alert for the arrival of luck
  - Enjoy the process along with the proceeds(profits), because the process is where you live. 

8. Decisiveness(make decision quickly) -- When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction.
  - Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful
  - Opportunity doesn't come often, so seize it when it does
  - Opportunity meeting the prepared mind: that's the game

9. Change -- Live with change and accept unremovable complexity
  - Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you. 
  - Continually challenge and willingly amend your "best-loved ideas"
  - Recognize reality even when you don't like it--especially when you don't like it
 
10. Focus -- Keep things simple and remember what you set out to do
  - Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets -- and can be lost in a heartbeat
  - Guard against the effects of hubris(overconfidence) and boredom(the state of feeling bored)
  - Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae(别由于细节忽视了大方向，重点)
  - Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop: "A small leak can sink a great ship"
  - Face your big troubles: don't sweep them under the rug
