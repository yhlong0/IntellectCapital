# Rule #1

1. Change your thoughts, and you change your world. 
2. Are you taking a lot of risk going from A to B? If you put someone in the driver's seat who doesn't know how to drive, a relatively safe trip becomes an incredibly risky trip. 
3. Learn Rule #1 and avoid making the mistake in the first plance
4. What do you love to do, professionally and as recreation? What things are you really good at? What do you do to make money or what do you spend money on? Draw three circles and list the things, the middle or cross areas are your circle of competence.
