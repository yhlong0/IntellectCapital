# Rule #1

1. Change your thoughts, and you change your world. 
2. Are you taking a lot of risk going from A to B? If you put someone in the driver's seat who doesn't know how to drive, a relatively safe trip becomes an incredibly risky trip. 
3. Learn Rule #1 and avoid making the mistake in the first plance
4. What do you love to do, professionally and as recreation? What things are you really good at? What do you do to make money or what do you spend money on? Draw three circles and list the things, the middle or cross areas are your circle of competence. 
5. A wide moat is much more predictable next 20 years than a business with no moat. 
6. Five Moats
  - **Brand**, a product you're willing to pay more for because you trust it, e.g. Coke, Gillette, Disney
  - **Secret**, a business that has a patent or trade secret that makes direct competition illegal or very difficult, e.g. Pfizer, Intel
  - **Toll**, a business with exclusive control of a market--giving the ability to collect a "toll" from anyone need that service or product, e.g. media companies, utilities, ad agencies
  - **Switching**, a business that's much a part of your life switching worth the trouble, e.g. ADR Paychex, H&R Block, Microsoft
  - **Price**, a business that can price products so low no one can compete, e.g. Walmart, Costco, Home Depot
7. If a business's equity isn't growing, the business doesn't have the funds to spend on increasing its market or developing new products. Maybe earnings are simply being channeled back into maintaining the business, Berkshire Hathaway. 
8. Check Sales/EPS growth rate for the last 10 years.
9. There's nothing certain about a nice story, you have to go behind it and find the numbers to back it up. Don't get sold a story!
10. CEO determines the focus of the company, the happiness of people working there, and ultimately the ROI. 
11. Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it. (How to figure out right CEO)
12. An investor are marrying the CEO, don't marry anyone unless you know and agree with how they're spending your money.
13. The second quality of a great CEO is that he or she is driven to change the world. BAG -- Big Audacious(bold) Goal.
