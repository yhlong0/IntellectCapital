# The Most Important Thing

1. Experience is what you got when you didn't get what you wanted. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough time.
2. Your goal in investing isn't to earn average return(index ETF will give you that easily), you want to do better than average. Thus, your thinking has to be 
better than that of others--both more powerful and at a higher level. Since other investors may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, you must find an edge they don't have. You must thinking of something they haven't thought of, see things they miss or bring insight they don't prossess. You have to react differently and behave differently. In short, being right may be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won't be sufficient. You must be more right than others ... which by definition means your thinking has to be different. Once you come up an appealing investment idea, the first test is "Who doesn't know that?"
3. For every person who gets a good buy in an inefficient market, someone else sells too cheap. One of the great sayings about poker is that "In every game there's a fish. If you've played for 45 minutes and haven't figured out who the fish is, then it's you."
4. To get higher returns, all you have to do is make riskier investments? This can't be true, because if riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn't be riskier. 
5. The choice isn't really between value and growth, but between value today and value tomorrow. 
6. It's hard to consistently do the right thing as an investor. But it's impossible to consistently do the right thing at the right time.
7. Everyone hopes a buyer will come along who's willing to overpay for what they have for sale. But certainly the hoped-for arrival of this sucker can't be counted on. Unlike having an underpriced asset move to its fair value, expecting appreciation on the part of fairly priced or overpriced asset requires irrationality on the part of buyers that absolutely cannot be considered dependable.
8. In order to attract capital, riskier investments have to offer the prospect of higher returns, or higher promised returns, or higher expected returns. But there's absolutely nothing to say those higher prospective returns have to materialized. 
9. Risk means more things can happen than will happen, risk will be low only if investors behave prudently.
10. Over a full career, most investors' results will be determined more by how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness of their winners.
