# Getting to Yes

### Separate the People from the Problem


- Soft on the people while remaining hard on the problem. 
- Put yourself in their shoes.
- Don't deduce(推测) their intentions from your fears
- Don't blame them for your problem. When you talk about the problem, distinguish the symptonms from the person with whom you are talking. 



### Focus on Interests, Not Positions

- Discuss each other's perceptions. 
- Look for opportunities to act inconsistently. (Egypt's president visit enemy's captial which not recognized by other and finally make a deal)
- Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process.

- Let me see whether I follow what you are telling me. From your point of view, the situation looks like this...

### Invent Options for Mutual Gain

- There are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options: 1) permature judgement. 2) searching fo the single answer. 3) the assumptions of a fixed pie. 4) thinking that "solving their problem is their problem. "
- To invent creative options: 1) separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them. 2) broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer. 3) search for mutual gains. 4) invent ways of making their decisions easy. 
- Invent ideas first, decide later. Invent ideas without pausing to consider whether they are good or bad, realistic or unrealistic. 

### Insist on Using Objective Criteria
