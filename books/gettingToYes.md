# Getting to Yes

### Separate the People from the Problem


- Soft on the people while remaining hard on the problem. 
- Put yourself in their shoes.
- Don't deduce(推测) their intentions from your fears
- Don't blame them for your problem. When you talk about the problem, distinguish the symptonms from the person with whom you are talking. 



### Focus on Interests, Not Positions

- Discuss each other's perceptions. 
- Look for opportunities to act inconsistently. (Egypt's president visit enemy's captial which not recognized by other and finally make a deal)
- Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process.
- Positional bargaining is next to impossible. It may take all to say yes, but only one to say no. Reciprocal(互相) concessions are difficult. 
- You may so busy thinking about what you are going to say next, how you are going to respond to that last point that you forget to listen to what the other side is saying now. 
- The cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard.
- Let me see whether I follow what you are telling me. From your point of view, the situation looks like this...

### Invent Options for Mutual Gain

- There are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options: 1) permature judgement. 2) searching fo the single answer. 3) the assumptions of a fixed pie. 4) thinking that "solving their problem is their problem. "
- To invent creative options: 1) separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them. 2) broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer. 3) search for mutual gains. 4) invent ways of making their decisions easy. 
- Invent ideas first, decide later. Invent ideas without pausing to consider whether they are good or bad, realistic or unrealistic. 
- When brainstorm for ideas, it consists of questions, not assertions. "One options is ..., What other options have you thought of? What if we agreed to this? How about doing it this way?"
- Look through the eyes of different experts.(get advice or more ideas from experts)
- What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off?

### Insist on Using Objective Criteria

- People generally assume that differences between two parties create the problem. Yet differences can also lead to a solution. 
- Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them.
- Be open to reason, but closed to threats
- The adge-old way to divide a piece of cake between two children: one cuts and the other chooses. 
- Frame each issue as a joint search for objective criteria, (the cost of the house adjusted for depreciation, recent sale prices of similar houses, independent appraisal), if the seller starts by giving you a position price, ask for the theory behind that price, how did you arrive at that figure?
- But the protection afforded by adopting a bottom line involves high costs. It limits your ability to benefit from what your learn during negotiation. By definition, a bottom line is a position that is not be changed. To that extent you have shut your ears. Moreover, a bottom line is likely to be set too high.
- Your best alternative to a negotiated agreement(BATNA)
- Generate BATNA: 
  1) Inventing a list of actions you might conceivably take if no agreement is reached
  2) improving some of the more promising ideas and converting them into practical alternatives
  3) selecting, tentatively(subject to further conformation）, the one alternative that seems best. 
- Silence is one of your best weapons. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word.
- One-text procedure(invovle a middle man, help gather/reconcile the requirements). Simply prepare a draft and ask for criticism.
