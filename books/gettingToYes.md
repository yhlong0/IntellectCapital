# Getting to Yes

### Separate the People from the Problem


- Soft on the people while remaining hard on the problem. 
- Put yourself in their shoes.
- Don't deduce(推测) their intentions from your fears
- Don't blame them for your problem. When you talk about the problem, distinguish the symptonms from the person with whom you are talking. 
- Discuss each other's perceptions. 
- Look for opportunities to act inconsistently. (Egypt's president visit enemy's captial which not recognized by other and finally make a deal)
- Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process.
- Positional bargaining is next to impossible. It may take all to say yes, but only one to say no. Reciprocal(互相) concessions are difficult. 
- You may so busy thinking about what you are going to say next, how you are going to respond to that last point that you forget to listen to what the other side is saying now. 
- The cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard.
- Let me see whether I follow what you are telling me. From your point of view, the situation looks like this...


### Focus on Interests, Not Positions

### Invent Options for Mutual Gain

### Insist on Using Objective Criteria
