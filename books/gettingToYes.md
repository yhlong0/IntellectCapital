# Getting to Yes

### Separate the People from the Problem


- Soft on the people while remaining hard on the problem. 
- Put yourself in their shoes.
- Don't deduce(推测) their intentions from your fears
- Don't blame them for your problem. When you talk about the problem, distinguish the symptonms from the person with whom you are talking. 
- Discuss each other's perceptions. 
- Look for opportunities to act inconsistently. (Egypt's president visit enemy's captial which not recognized by other and finally make a deal)
- Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process.


### Focus on Interests, Not Positions

### Invent Options for Mutual Gain

### Insist on Using Objective Criteria
