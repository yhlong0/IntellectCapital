# The Barefoot Investor

1. People always say I've left it too late...I should have saved more when I was younger. Stop for a second and tell me what age you'll be when you die. You might have a ballpark figure for how many years you've got left on the planet, what are you going to do with them? You can continue living in the past, or you can rise up and make yourself pround. 
2. **Only insure against things that can kill you financially.** Your iPhone breaking will not kill you financially, so don't take out extended warranty insurance. House, car, health.
3. Losing everything after house burn down, teach us the art of conscious spending. We think about the things that genuinely make our lives more meaningful, or more comfortable, and we spend extravagantly on them, guilt-free. At the same time, we look at the stuff that we buy unconsciously and ruthlessly cut it out.
