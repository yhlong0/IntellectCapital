1. People always say I've left it too late...I should have saved more when I was younger. Stop for a second and tell me what age you'll be when you die. You might have a ballpark figure for how many years you've got left on the planet, what are you going to do with them? You can continue living in the past, or you can rise up and make yourself pround. 
2. **Only insure against things that can kill you financially.** Your iPhone breaking will not kill you financially, so don't take out extended warranty insurance. House, car, health.
3. Losing everything after house burn down, teach us the art of conscious spending. We think about the things that genuinely make our lives more meaningful, or more comfortable, and we spend extravagantly on them, guilt-free. At the same time, we look at the stuff that we buy unconsciously and ruthlessly cut it out.
4. Car loans in your 20s will rob you in your 30s and 40s, get a car that less than half of your annual income in cash.
5. Becareful of credit card, no matter what, I'm not going to take out a high-interest loan to fund crap I don't need. No matter what, I'm going to set an example for the people around me.
