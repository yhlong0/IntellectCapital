# The Little Book That Beats the Market

- earning yeild
- return on asset
- buying above-average companies at below average prices. 


## Magic Formula

1. Sort all stocks by their earning yeild from highest to lowest.
2. Sort all stocks by their return on asset from highest to lowest.
3. Add rank together and find the top 30.
4. Ideally, better than blindly plugging in last year's earning to the formula, we should be plugging in estimates for earnings in a normal year or future three to four year's.
5. We would then be able to take our estimates of normal earnings and calculate P/E and ROA.
6. Based on how confident about our estimates and risk-free government bond to decide whether it is good opportunities.
7. If this sound hard to do, **You have no business investing in individual stocks on your own!**

### Caveat 

1. The formula could not working for couple years and people lost the faith and looking for a "better" solution.
2. The business competitor could make future earning and return lower. However, author believe the formula should give you **above the average business at below average price** which have better moat and able to reinvest their profit to make moat deeper. 


### Notes

1. On Wall Street, there is no tooth fairy. Once you leave home, you can put your money under a professional’s pillow, but chances are, when you wake up, all you’ll be left with is lousy performance.
2. If you don’t know how to evaluate businesses and project normal earnings several years into the future, you have no business investing in individual stocks in the first place.
