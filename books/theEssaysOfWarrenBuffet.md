# The Essays Of Warren Buffett

1. The inquiry is whether after-tax returns on an investment are at least equal to the purchasing power of the initial investment plus a fair rate of return. 
2. Long-term investment success depends not on studying betas and maintaining a diversified portfolio, but on recognizing that as an investor, one is the owner of a business. Reconfiguring a porfolio by buying and selling stocks to accommodate the desired beta-risk profile defeats long-term investment success. Such "flitting from flower to flower" imposes huge transaction costs in the forms of spreads, fees and commissions, not to mention taxes. An investor who trades actively in the market is like repeatedly engages in one-night stands a romantic. 
3. Put all your eggs in one basket---and watch the basket.
4. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. 
5. Speculator hopes that price will rise, rather than the conviction that the price being paid is lower than the value being obtained. 
6. There are not distinct between "growth investing" and "value investing". They are integrally linked since **growth must be treated as a component of value**.
7. Acquisitions paid for in stock: buyer sells part of itself to acquire seller. Thinking in this way, it would enable one to evaluate what the buyer is giving up to make the acquisition.

10. We use debt sparingly(节俭) and, when we do borrow, we attempt to structure our loans on a long-term fixed-rate basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. 
11. Once a company moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to engage in further accounting maneuvers that must be even more "heroic". These can turn fudging into fraud.(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.)
12. 巴菲特说如果公司账目看着有点不对，就像你在厨房里看到一只蟑螂，通常这时候厨房不太可能只有一只蟑螂。There is seldom just one cockroah in the kitchen. 
13. Charlie and I not only don't know today what our businesses will earn next year---we don't even know what they will earn next quarter. We are suspicious of those CEOs who regularly claim they do know the future---and we become downright incredulous(完全不信任) if they consistently reach their declared targets. Managers that always promise to "make the numbers" will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers.
