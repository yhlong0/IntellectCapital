# The Essays Of Warren Buffett

1. The inquiry is whether after-tax returns on an investment are at least equal to the purchasing power of the initial investment plus a fair rate of return. 
2. Long-term investment success depends not on studying betas and maintaining a diversified portfolio, but on recognizing that as an investor, one is the owner of a business. Reconfiguring a porfolio by buying and selling stocks to accommodate the desired beta-risk profile defeats long-term investment success. Such "flitting from flower to flower" imposes huge transaction costs in the forms of spreads, fees and commissions, not to mention taxes. An investor who trades actively in the market is like repeatedly engages in one-night stands a romantic. 
3. Put all your eggs in one basket---and watch the basket.
4. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. 
5. Speculator hopes that price will rise, rather than the conviction that the price being paid is lower than the value being obtained. 
6. There are not distinct between "growth investing" and "value investing". They are integrally linked since **growth must be treated as a component of value**.
7. Acquisitions paid for in stock: buyer sells part of itself to acquire seller. Thinking in this way, it would enable one to evaluate what the buyer is giving up to make the acquisition. 
8. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. （现金流折现）
9. If you don't understand investment and play with margin will kill you. If you do, there is no need for margin. 
10. We use debt sparingly(节俭) and, when we do borrow, we attempt to structure our loans on a long-term fixed-rate basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. 
11. Once a company moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to engage in further accounting maneuvers that must be even more "heroic". These can turn fudging into fraud.(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.)
12. 巴菲特说如果公司账目看着有点不对，就像你在厨房里看到一只蟑螂，通常这时候厨房不太可能只有一只蟑螂。There is seldom just one cockroah in the kitchen. 
13. Charlie and I not only don't know today what our businesses will earn next year---we don't even know what they will earn next quarter. We are suspicious of those CEOs who regularly claim they do know the future---and we become downright incredulous(完全不信任) if they consistently reach their declared targets. Managers that always promise to "make the numbers" will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers. 
14. 当年的报纸行业也是有赢家通吃的效果，如果当地有几家报纸，通常规模大一点的，浏览量多，广告商也会更倾向于找它投放广告，它的良性循环，导致其他报纸则会进入恶性循环。电视互联网颠覆了报纸行业，将来什么能颠覆互联网或者google，facebook这种公司呢？
15. We can afford to lose money---even a lot of money. But we can't afford to lose reputation---even a shred of reputation.
16. There's plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it's questionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.
17. As they say in poker, "If you've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy."
18. Berkshire's only participate a few arbitrage. If you have 50 or more per year, you must spend most your time monitoring both the progress of deals and the market movements of the related stocks. This is not how Charlie nor I wish to spend our lives. What's the sense in getting rich just to stare at a ticker tape all day?
19. We do know that the less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs. If something can't go on forever, it will end. 
20. The know-nothing investor can actually out-perform most investment professionals by investing in an index fund. Paradoxically, when "dumb" money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb. 
21. Occasionally the stock market offers us the chance to buy non-controlling pieces of extraordinary business at truly ridiculous prices. 
22. "Value Investing" is redundant. What is "investing" if it is not the act of seeking value at least sufficient to justify the amount paid? Consciously paying more for a stock than its calculated value---in the hope that it can soon be sold for a still-higher price---should be labeled speculation. 
23. If a business is complex or subject to constant change, we're not smart enough to predict future cash flows.
24. Whose economics are likely to be unexciting over the next few years, this bothers us not an iota. We can be very patient. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take times. 
25. After bought ABC, they let CEO Tom votes our stock, we intend to promote stability where it otherwise might be lacking. That kind of certainty, combined with a good manager and a good business, provides excellent soil for a rich financial harvest. 
26. If the choice is between a questionable business at a comfortable price or a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer the latter. 
27. For 10M business sell for 8M, it might take years to gain that 2M profit, time is the friend of the wonder business, the enemy of the mediocre. 
28. Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However, that's also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gain, your spouse thinks you're clever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, very few people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade---and some relearned in 2008---any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers maybe, evaporates when multiplied by a single zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smart people. 
29. Leverage can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that these obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either because of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by payment. For that, only cash will do the job.
30. Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed. When either is missing, that's all that is noticed. **Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.** In 2008, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously close to bringing our entire country to its knees. 
31. By being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of liquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our economy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival. 
32. We heard "cash is king" in late 2008, just when cash should have been deployed rather than held. 
33. As Jesse Unruh might have put it, transcations are the mother's milk of finance.
34. A base business can not be transformed into a golden business by tricks of accounting or capital structure. The man claiming to be a financial alchemist may become rich. But gullible(易受骗的) investors rather than business achievements will usually be the source of his wealth. 
35. When a problem exists, whether in personnel or in business operations, the time to act is now.
36. Derivatives, just like stocks and bonds, are sometimes wildly mis-priced. They have dramatically increased the leverage and risks, so they are dangerous. Derivatives have made it almost impossible for investors to understand and analyze our largest commercial banks and investment banks. 
37. Putting people into homes, though a desirable goal, shouldn't be our country's primary objective. Keeping them in their homes should be the ambition. 
38. Stocks can't outperform businesses indefinitely, for investors as a whole, return decrease as motion increases. 
39. In the mid-1970s repurchases of company shares was a tipoff that company was both undervalued and run by a shareholder-oriented management. Right now, you have to analysis whether they are buying dollar bill for $1.10. 
40. We have no interest in supporting the stock, nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strength that is unquestionable takes precedence over all else. 
41. People who buy for non-value reasons are likely to sell for non-value reasons. 
42. Practice doesn't make perfect, practice makes permanent.
